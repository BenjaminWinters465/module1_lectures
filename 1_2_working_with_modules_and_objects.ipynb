Therefore, we do NOT keep these books\\r\\nin compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\\r\\nof the official release dates, for time for better editing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\\r\\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\\r\\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\\r\\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\\r\\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\\r\\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\\r\\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\\r\\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\\r\\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\\r\\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\\r\\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\\r\\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\\r\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\\r\\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\\r\\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\r\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Single, my dear, to be sure!  A single man of large\\r\\nfortune; four or five thousand a year.  What a fine thing for our\\r\\ngirls!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so?  How can it affect them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so\\r\\n tiresome!  You must know that I am thinking of his marrying\\r\\none of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Design!  Nonsense, how can you talk so!  But it is very likely\\r\\nthat he MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\r\\nmust visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see no occasion for that.  You and the girls may go, or you\\r\\nmay send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still\\r\\nbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley\\r\\nmay like you the best of the party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, you flatter me.  I certainly HAVE had my share of\\r\\nbeauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\r\\nWhen a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give\\r\\nover thinking of her own beauty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think\\r\\nof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when\\r\\nhe comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But consider your daughters.  Only think what an\\r\\nestablishment it would be for one of them.  Sir William and\\r\\nLady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for\\r\\nin general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you\\r\\nmust go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do\\r\\nnot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely.  I dare say Mr. Bingley will\\r\\nbe very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\r\\nassure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\r\\nchooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for\\r\\n my little Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing.  Lizzy is not a bit better\\r\\nthan the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\r\\nJane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\r\\ngiving HER the preference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied\\r\\nhe; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\r\\nsomething more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a\\r\\nway?  You take delight in vexing me.  You have no compassion\\r\\nfor my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mistake me, my dear.  I have a high respect for your\\r\\nnerves.  They are my old friends.  I have heard you mention\\r\\nthem with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic\\r\\nhumour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-\\r\\ntwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand\\r\\nhis character.  HER mind was less difficult to develop.  She was\\r\\na woman of mean understanding, little information, and\\r\\nuncertain temper.  When she was discontented, she fancied\\r\\nherself nervous.  The business of her life was to get her\\r\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\r\\nalways assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\r\\nevening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.  It\\r\\nwas then disclosed in the following manner: --Observing his\\r\\nsecond daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly\\r\\naddressed her with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes,\" said\\r\\nher mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet\\r\\nhim at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.  She has two\\r\\nnieces of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\r\\nhave no opinion of her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that\\r\\nyou do not depend on her serving you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to\\r\\ncontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\\'s sake!  Have a little\\r\\ncompassion on my nerves.  You tear them to pieces.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she\\r\\ntimes them ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty fretfully.\\r\\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come\\r\\nback till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to\\r\\nintroduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\r\\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\r\\nwith him myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is\\r\\ncertainly very little.  One cannot know what a man really is by\\r\\nthe end of a fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else\\r\\nwill; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their\\r\\nchance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if\\r\\nyou decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\r\\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried\\r\\nhe.  \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress\\r\\nthat is laid on them, as nonsense?  I cannot quite agree with you\\r\\nTHERE. What say you, Mary?  For you are a young lady of\\r\\ndeep reflection, I know, and read great books and make\\r\\nextracts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that\\r\\nbefore?  If I had known as much this morning I certainly would\\r\\nnot have called on him.  It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\r\\npaid the visit; we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first\\r\\ntumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\r\\nhad expected all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!  But I knew I\\r\\nshould\\r\\npersuade you at last.  I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\r\\nneglect such an acquaintance.  Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\r\\nsuch a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning\\r\\nand never said a word about it till now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr.\\r\\nBennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\r\\nraptures of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when the\\r\\ndoor was shut.  \"I do not know how you will ever make him\\r\\namends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.  At our\\r\\ntime of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\r\\nacquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\r\\nanything.  Lydia, my love, though you ARE the youngest, I dare\\r\\nsay Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I AM the\\r\\nyoungest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\r\\nwould return Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and determining when they\\r\\nshould ask him to dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\r\\nfive daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\r\\nfrom her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\r\\nThey attacked him in various way-- with barefaced questions,\\r\\ningenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\r\\nskill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\\r\\nsecond-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.  Her\\r\\nreport was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted\\r\\nwith him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome,\\r\\nextremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be\\r\\nat the next assembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more\\r\\ndelightful!  To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards\\r\\nfalling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\\'s heart\\r\\nwere entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\r\\nNetherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the\\r\\nothers equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\\'s visit, and sat\\r\\nabout ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained\\r\\nhopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of\\r\\nwhose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.\\r\\nThe ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the\\r\\nadvantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore\\r\\na blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\r\\nalready had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\r\\ncredit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which\\r\\ndeferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the\\r\\nfollowing day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour\\r\\nof their invitation, etc.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\\r\\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so\\r\\nsoon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear\\r\\nthat he might be always flying about from one place to another,\\r\\nand never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas\\r\\nquieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone\\r\\nto London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report\\r\\nsoon followed, that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\\r\\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls grieved\\r\\nover such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day\\r\\nbefore the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought\\r\\nonly six with him from London-- his five sisters and a cousin.\\r\\nAnd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of\\r\\nonly five altogether-- Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband\\r\\nof the eldest, and another young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a\\r\\npleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His\\r\\nsisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.  His\\r\\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but\\r\\nhis friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by\\r\\nhis fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the\\r\\nreport which was in general circulation within five minutes\\r\\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The\\r\\ngentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the\\r\\nladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and\\r\\nhe was looked at with great admiration for about half the\\r\\nevening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of\\r\\nhis popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above\\r\\nhis company, and above being pleased; and not all his large\\r\\nestate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\r\\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to\\r\\nbe compared with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\r\\nprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\r\\ndanced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,\\r\\nand talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable\\r\\nqualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between\\r\\nhim and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.\\r\\nHurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced\\r\\nto any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking\\r\\nabout the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\r\\nHis character was decided.  He was the proudest, most\\r\\ndisagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he\\r\\nwould never come there again.  Amongst the most violent\\r\\nagainst him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general\\r\\nbehaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\r\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of\\r\\ngentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that\\r\\ntime, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear\\r\\na conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from\\r\\nthe dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance.  I hate to see\\r\\nyou standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.  You had\\r\\nmuch better dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am\\r\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly as\\r\\nthis it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged, and\\r\\nthere is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\r\\npunishment to me to stand up with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley,\\r\\n\"for a kingdom!  Upon my honour, I never met with so many\\r\\npleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are\\r\\nseveral of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\"\\r\\nsaid Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!  But\\r\\nthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is\\r\\nvery pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my\\r\\npartner to introduce you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a\\r\\nmoment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own\\r\\nand coldly said:  \"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to\\r\\ntempt ME; I am in no humour at present to give consequence\\r\\nto young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better\\r\\nreturn to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting\\r\\nyour time with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\r\\nElizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.\\r\\nShe told the story, however, with great spirit among her\\r\\nfriends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted\\r\\nin anything ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole\\r\\nfamily.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much\\r\\nadmired by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with\\r\\nher twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane\\r\\nwas as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in\\r\\na quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane\\'s pleasure.  Mary had heard\\r\\nherself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished\\r\\ngirl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\r\\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all\\r\\nthat they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned,\\r\\ntherefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they\\r\\nlived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They\\r\\nfound Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book he was regardless of\\r\\ntime; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of\\r\\ncuriosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such\\r\\nsplendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that his wife\\'s\\r\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon\\r\\nfound out that he had a different story to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have\\r\\nhad a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish you\\r\\nhad been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\r\\nEverybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought\\r\\nher quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!  Only think of\\r\\nTHAT, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was\\r\\nthe only creature in the room that he asked a second time.\\r\\nFirst of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to see him\\r\\nstand up with her!  But, however, he did not admire her at all;\\r\\nindeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with\\r\\nJane as she was going down the dance.  So he inquired who she\\r\\nwas, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.  Then\\r\\nthe two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with\\r\\n Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two\\r\\nsixth with Lizzy, and the BOULANGER--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he had had any compassion for ME,\" cried her husband\\r\\nimpatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much!  For God\\'s\\r\\nsake, say no more of his partners.  O that he had\\r\\nsprained his ankle in the first place!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him.  He is so\\r\\nexcessively handsome!  And his sisters are charming women.  I\\r\\nnever in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.  I\\r\\ndare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\\'s gown--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against\\r\\nany description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek\\r\\nanother branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness\\r\\nof spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose\\r\\nmuch by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,\\r\\nhorrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so conceited\\r\\nthat there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and he\\r\\nwalked there, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome\\r\\nenough to dance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to\\r\\nhave given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\r\\ncautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\r\\nsister just how very much she admired him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\r\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--\\r\\nso much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man\\r\\nought likewise to be, if he possibly can.  His character is thereby\\r\\ncomplete.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\r\\ntime.  I did not expect such a compliment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did not you? I did for you.  But that is one great difference\\r\\nbetween us.  Compliments always take YOU by surprise, and\\r\\nME never.  What could be more natural than his asking you\\r\\nagain?  He could not help seeing that you were about five times\\r\\nas pretty as every other woman in the room.  No thanks to his\\r\\ngallantry for that.  Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I\\r\\ngive you leave to like him.  You have liked many a stupider\\r\\nperson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\r\\ngeneral.  You never see a fault in anybody.  All the world are\\r\\ngood and agreeable in your eyes.  I never heard you speak ill of\\r\\na human being in your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\\r\\nspeak what I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know you do; and it is THAT which makes the wonder.  With\\r\\nYOUR good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\r\\nnonsense of others!  Affectation of candour is common enough--\\r\\none meets with it everywhere.  But to be candid without\\r\\nostentation or design-- to take the good of everybody\\'s\\r\\ncharacter and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--\\r\\nbelongs to you alone.  And so you like this man\\'s sisters, too, do\\r\\nyou?  Their manners are not equal to his.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not-- at first.  But they are very pleasing women when\\r\\nyou converse with them.  Miss Bingley is to live with her\\r\\nbrother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall\\r\\nnot find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\r\\nbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\r\\ngeneral; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\r\\nof temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\\r\\nany attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\r\\nthem.  They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\r\\nhumour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\\r\\nthemselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\r\\nconceited.  They were rather handsome, had been educated in\\r\\none of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of\\r\\ntwenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more\\r\\nthan they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and\\r\\nwere therefore in every respect entitled to think well of\\r\\nthemselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable\\r\\nfamily in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\\r\\nimpressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune\\r\\nand their own had been acquired by trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a\\r\\nhundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to\\r\\npurchase an estate, but did not live to do it.  Mr. Bingley\\r\\nintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county;\\r\\nbut as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of\\r\\na manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the\\r\\neasiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\r\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next\\r\\ngeneration to purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\\r\\nthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\r\\nwas by no means unwilling to preside at his table-- nor was Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\r\\ndisposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\r\\nMr. Bingley had not been or age two years, when he was tempted\\r\\nby an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.\\r\\nHe did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour-- was pleased with\\r\\nthe situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the\\r\\nowner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\r\\nspite of great opposition of character.  Bingley was endeared to\\r\\nDarcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\r\\nthough no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\r\\nand though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.  On the\\r\\nstrength of Darcy\\'s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\r\\nof his judgement the highest opinion.  In understanding, Darcy\\r\\nwas the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy\\r\\nwas clever.  He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\r\\nfastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\r\\nIn that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.  Bingley was\\r\\nsure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\r\\ngiving offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\r\\nsufficiently characteristic.  Bingley had never met with more\\r\\npleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\r\\nmost kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\r\\nstiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\\r\\nto Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\r\\nDarcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\r\\nthere was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\r\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention\\r\\nor pleasure.  Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she\\r\\nsmiled too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so-- but still they\\r\\nadmired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet\\r\\ngirl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\\r\\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their\\r\\nbrother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as\\r\\nhe chose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom\\r\\nthe Bennets were particularly intimate.  Sir William Lucas had\\r\\nbeen formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a\\r\\ntolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an\\r\\naddress to the king during his mayoralty.  The distinction had\\r\\nperhaps been felt too strongly.  It had given him a disgust to\\r\\nhis business, and to his residence in a small market town; and,\\r\\nin quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a\\r\\nhouse about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that\\r\\nperiod Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his\\r\\nown importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself\\r\\nsolely in being civil to all the world.  For, though elated by his\\r\\nrank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was\\r\\nall attention to everybody.  By nature inoffensive, friendly, and\\r\\nobliging, his presentation at St. James\\'s had made him\\r\\ncourteous.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to\\r\\nbe a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.  They had several\\r\\nchildren.  The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young\\r\\nwoman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to\\r\\ntalk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after\\r\\nthe assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\r\\ncommunicate. \"YOU began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.  \"YOU\\r\\nwere Mr. Bingley\\'s first choice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her\\r\\ntwice. To be sure that DID seem as if he admired her-- indeed I\\r\\nrather believe he DID-- I heard something about it-- but I\\r\\nhardly know what-- something about Mr. Robinson.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.\\r\\nRobinson; did not I mention it to you?  Mr. Robinson\\'s asking\\r\\nhim how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did\\r\\nnot think there were a great many pretty women in the room,\\r\\nand WHICH he thought the prettiest? and his answering\\r\\nimmediately to the last question:  \\'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\\r\\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word!  Well, that is very decided indeed-- that does\\r\\nseem as if-- but, however, it may all come to nothing, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS,\\r\\nEliza,\" said Charlotte.  \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth\\r\\nlistening to as his friend, is he?-- poor Eliza!-- to be only just\\r\\nTOLERABLE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by\\r\\nhis ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it\\r\\nwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.  Mrs. Long\\r\\ntold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour\\r\\nwithout once opening his lips.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you quite sure, ma\\'am?-- is not there a little mistake?\"\\r\\nsaid Jane.  \"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield,\\r\\nand he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed\\r\\nquite angry at being spoke to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much,\\r\\nunless among his intimate acquaintances.  With THEM he is\\r\\nremarkably agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.  If he had been so very\\r\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.  But I can guess\\r\\nhow it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I\\r\\ndare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep\\r\\na carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas,\\r\\n\"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance\\r\\nwith HIM, if I were you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe, ma\\'am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance\\r\\nwith him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend ME so much as\\r\\npride often does, because there is an excuse for it.  One cannot\\r\\nwonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\r\\neverything in his favour, should think highly of himself.  If I\\r\\nmay so express it, he has a RIGHT to be proud.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily\\r\\nforgive HIS pride, if he had not mortified MINE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity\\r\\nof her reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\r\\nthat I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\r\\nindeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\r\\nthere are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\r\\nself-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\r\\nimaginary.  Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\r\\nwords are often used synonymously.  A person may be proud\\r\\nwithout being vain.  Pride relates more to our opinion of\\r\\nourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who\\r\\ncame with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was.  I\\r\\nwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a\\r\\nday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said\\r\\nMrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\r\\nyour bottle directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\r\\nthat she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.\\r\\nThe visit was soon returned in due form.  Miss Bennet\\'s\\r\\npleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\r\\nBingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable,\\r\\nand the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of\\r\\nbeing better acquainted with THEM was expressed towards\\r\\nthe two eldest.  By Jane, this attention was received with the\\r\\ngreatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in\\r\\ntheir treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister,\\r\\nand could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it\\r\\nwas, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence\\r\\nof their brother\\'s admiration.  It was generally evident\\r\\nwhenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was\\r\\nequally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which\\r\\nshe had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\r\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure\\r\\nthat it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general,\\r\\nsince Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure\\r\\nof temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would\\r\\nguard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.  She\\r\\nmentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to\\r\\nimpose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\r\\ndisadvantage to be so very guarded.  If a woman conceals her\\r\\naffection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\r\\nthe opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\r\\nconsolation to believe the world equally in the dark.  There is\\r\\nso much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that\\r\\nit is not safe to leave any to itself.  We can all BEGIN freely-- a\\r\\nslight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\r\\nwho have heart enough to be really in love without\\r\\nencouragement.  In nine cases out of ten a women had better\\r\\nshow MORE affection than she feels.  Bingley, likes your\\r\\nsister, undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if\\r\\nshe does not help him on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.  If\\r\\nI can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,\\r\\nindeed, not to discover it too.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as\\r\\nyou do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\r\\nconceal it, he must find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.  But, though\\r\\nBingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many\\r\\nhours together; and, as they always see each other in large\\r\\nmixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be\\r\\nemployed in conversing together.  Jane should therefore make\\r\\nthe most of every half-hour in which she can command his\\r\\nattention.  When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure\\r\\nfor falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is\\r\\nin question but the desire of being well married, and if I were\\r\\ndetermined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\r\\nshould adopt it.  But these are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not\\r\\nacting by design.  As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\r\\ndegree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.  She has\\r\\nknown him only a fortnight.  She danced four dances with him\\r\\nat Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and\\r\\nhas since dined with him in company four times. This is not\\r\\nquite enough to make her understand his character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, she\\r\\nmight only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\r\\nyou must remember that four evenings have also been spent\\r\\ntogether-- and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\r\\nthey both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect\\r\\nto any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much\\r\\nhas been unfolded.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\r\\nand if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she\\r\\nhad as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying\\r\\nhis character for a twelvemonth.  Happiness in marriage is\\r\\nentirely  a matter of chance.  If the dispositions of the parties are\\r\\never so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand,\\r\\nit does not advance their felicity in the least.  They always\\r\\ncontinue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their\\r\\nshare of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of\\r\\nthe defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.  You know\\r\\nit is not sound, and that you would never act in this way\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\\'s attentions to her sister,\\r\\nElizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\r\\nan object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\r\\nher without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\r\\nlooked at her only to criticise.  But no sooner had he made it\\r\\nclear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature\\r\\nin her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly\\r\\nintelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.  To this\\r\\ndiscovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.  Though he\\r\\nhad detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect\\r\\nsymmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure\\r\\nto be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her\\r\\nmanners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught\\r\\nby their easy playfulness.  Of this she was perfectly unaware; to\\r\\nher he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere,\\r\\nand who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\r\\nconversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\r\\nothers.  His doing so drew her notice.  It was at Sir William\\r\\nLucas\\'s, where a large party were assembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by\\r\\nlistening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\r\\nsee what he is about.  He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not\\r\\nbegin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of\\r\\nhim.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without\\r\\nseeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied\\r\\nher friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately\\r\\nprovoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself\\r\\nuncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster\\r\\nto give us a ball at Meryton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\r\\nenergetic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be HER turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas.  \"I\\r\\nam going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what\\r\\nfollows.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!-- always\\r\\nwanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!  If\\r\\nmy vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been\\r\\ninvaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before\\r\\nthose who must be in the habit of hearing the very best\\r\\nperformers.\"  On Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however, she added,\\r\\n\"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\"  And gravely glancing at Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\\r\\ncourse familiar with:  \\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge\\';\\r\\nand I shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.\\r\\nAfter a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties\\r\\nof several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded\\r\\nat the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence\\r\\nof being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for\\r\\nknowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for\\r\\ndisplay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\r\\nher application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\r\\nconceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\r\\nexcellence than she had reached.  Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\r\\nhad been listened to with much more pleasure, though not\\r\\nplaying half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto,\\r\\nwas glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish\\r\\nairs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the\\r\\nLucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at\\r\\none end of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode\\r\\nof passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\r\\nwas too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir\\r\\nWilliam Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as\\r\\none of the first refinements of polished society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\r\\namongst the less polished societies of the world.  Every savage\\r\\ncan dance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William only smiled.  \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\\r\\ncontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I\\r\\ndoubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\r\\nDarcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\r\\nsight.  Do you often dance at St. James\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the\\r\\nplace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself-- for I am\\r\\nfond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the\\r\\nair of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\r\\ndisposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\r\\ntowards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very\\r\\ngallant thing, and called out to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?  Mr. Darcy, you\\r\\nmust allow me to present this young lady to you as a very\\r\\ndesirable partner.  You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when\\r\\nso much beauty is before you.\"  And, taking her hand, he would\\r\\nhave given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised,\\r\\nwas not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back,\\r\\nand said with some discomposure to Sir William:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.  I entreat\\r\\nyou not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a\\r\\npartner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\\r\\nhonour of her hand, but in vain.  Elizabeth was determined; nor\\r\\ndid Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\\r\\npersuasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\\r\\ndeny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\\r\\ndislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I\\r\\nam sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\\r\\nEliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance-- for who would\\r\\nobject to such a partner?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away.  Her resistance had\\r\\nnot injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her\\r\\nwith some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass\\r\\nmany evenings in this manner-- in such society; and indeed I am\\r\\nquite of you opinion.  I was never more annoyed!  The insipidity,\\r\\nand yet the noise-- the nothingness, and yet the self-importance\\r\\nof all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on\\r\\nthem!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.  My mind was\\r\\nmore agreeably engaged.  I have been meditating on the very\\r\\ngreat pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty\\r\\nwoman can bestow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, a desired he\\r\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\\r\\nreflections.  Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley.  \"I am all\\r\\nastonishment.  How long has she been such a favourite?-- and\\r\\npray, when am I to wish you joy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.  A\\r\\nlady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\\r\\nlove, from love to matrimony, in a moment.  I knew you would\\r\\nbe wishing me joy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\\r\\nabsolutely settled.  You will be having a charming\\r\\nmother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at\\r\\nPemberley with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to\\r\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\\r\\nher that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\\r\\ntwo thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\\r\\nentailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their\\r\\nmother\\'s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could\\r\\nbut ill supply the deficiency of his.  Her father had been an\\r\\nattorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\\r\\nto their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\\r\\nsettled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a\\r\\nmost convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\\r\\ntempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\\r\\ntheir aunt and to a milliner\\'s shop just over the way.  The two\\r\\nyoungest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\\r\\nfrequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\\r\\ntheir sisters\\', and when nothing better offered, a walk to\\r\\nMeryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and\\r\\nfurnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\\r\\nthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\\r\\nsome from their aunt.  At present, indeed, they were well\\r\\nsupplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of\\r\\na militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the\\r\\nwhole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most\\r\\ninteresting intelligence.  Every day added something to their\\r\\nknowledge of the officers\\' names and connections.  Their\\r\\nlodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to\\r\\nknow the officers themselves.  Mr. Phillips visited them all, and\\r\\nthis opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.\\r\\nThey could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\\'s large\\r\\nfortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother,\\r\\nwas worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\\r\\nan ensign.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\r\\nBennet coolly observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\\r\\nbe two of the silliest girls in the country.  I have suspected it\\r\\nsome time, but I am now convinced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia,\\r\\nwith perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\\r\\nCaptain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\\r\\nday, as he was going the next morning to London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you should\\r\\nbe so ready to think your own children silly.  If I wished to think\\r\\nslightingly of anybody\\'s children, it should not be of my own,\\r\\nhowever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\\r\\nagree.  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\\r\\nparticular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\\r\\nyoungest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have\\r\\nthe sense of their father and mother.  When they get to our age, I\\r\\ndare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\r\\nI remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--\\r\\nand, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young\\r\\ncolonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my\\r\\ngirls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster\\r\\nlooked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in his\\r\\nregimentals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\\r\\nCaptain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did\\r\\nwhen they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\\r\\nClarke\\'s library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the\\r\\nfootman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield,\\r\\nand the servant waited for an answer.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s eyes\\r\\nsparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while\\r\\nher daughter read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from?  What is it about?  What does he\\r\\nsay?  Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--\\r\\n     \"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with\\r\\nLouisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for\\r\\nthe rest of our lives, for a whole day\\'s tete-a-tete between two\\r\\nwomen can never end without a quarrel.  Come as soon as you\\r\\ncan on receipt of this.  My brother and the gentlemen are to dine\\r\\nwith the officers.-- Yours ever,\\r\\n                                             \"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia.  \"I wonder my aunt did not tell\\r\\nus of THAT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\\r\\nlikely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were\\r\\nsure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\\'s chaise to go to\\r\\nMeryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\r\\nThey are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s\\r\\npurpose will be answered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that\\r\\nthe horses were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on\\r\\nhorseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\\r\\ncheerful prognostics of a bad day.  Her hopes were answered;\\r\\nJane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters\\r\\nwere uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain\\r\\ncontinued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly\\r\\ncould not some back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet more\\r\\nthan once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.  Till\\r\\nthe next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity\\r\\nof her contrivance.  Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant\\r\\nfrom Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--\\r\\n     \"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I\\r\\nsuppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.\\r\\nMy kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\\r\\nThey insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones-- therefore do not be\\r\\nalarmed if you should hear of his having been to me-- and,\\r\\nexcepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\\r\\nmatter with me.-- Yours, etc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\\r\\nnote aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\\r\\nillness-- if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\\r\\nwas all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying.  People do not die of little\\r\\ntrifling colds.  She will be taken good care of.  As long as she\\r\\nstays there, it is all very well.  I would go an see her if I could\\r\\nhave the carriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\r\\nthough the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\r\\nhorsewoman, walking was her only alternative.  She declared her\\r\\nresolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such\\r\\na thing, in all this dirt!  You will not be fit to be seen when you\\r\\nget there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane-- which is all I want.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the horses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\r\\nnothing when one has a motive; only three miles.  I shall be back\\r\\nby dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but\\r\\nevery impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\r\\nopinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\r\\nrequired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and\\r\\nLydia.  Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\r\\nladies set off together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps\\r\\nwe may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the\\r\\nlodgings of one of the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued\\r\\nher walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping\\r\\nover stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity,\\r\\nand finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\r\\nankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\r\\nexercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane\\r\\nwere assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal\\r\\nof surprise.  That she should have walked three miles so early in\\r\\nthe day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost\\r\\nincredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nconvinced that they held her in contempt for it.  She was\\r\\nreceived, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\\'s\\r\\nmanners there was something better than politeness; there was\\r\\ngood humour and kindness.  Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\\r\\nHurst nothing at all.  The former was divided between\\r\\nadmiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her\\r\\ncomplexion, and doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming\\r\\nso far alone.  The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\r\\nMiss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\r\\nnot well enough to leave her room.  Elizabeth was glad to be\\r\\ntaken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld\\r\\nby the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in\\r\\nher note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at\\r\\nher entrance.  She was not equal, however, to much\\r\\nconversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could\\r\\nattempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\\r\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with.  Elizabeth silently\\r\\nattended her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and\\r\\nElizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\r\\naffection and solicitude they showed for Jane.  The apothecary\\r\\ncame, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\r\\nsupposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\r\\nendeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\r\\nand promised her some draughts.  The advice was followed\\r\\nreadily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached\\r\\nacutely.  Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\\r\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had,\\r\\nin fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\r\\nvery unwillingly said so.  Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\r\\nand she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\r\\ntestified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\r\\nobliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\r\\nremain at Netherfield for the present.  Elizabeth most thankfully\\r\\nconsented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to\\r\\nacquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of\\r\\nclothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt five o\\'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\r\\nsix Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.  To the civil inquiries\\r\\nwhich then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure\\r\\nof distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nshe could not make a very favourable answer.  Jane was by no\\r\\nmeans better.  The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\r\\ntimes how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have\\r\\na bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill\\r\\nthemselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\r\\nindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them\\r\\nrestored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\r\\ncould regard with any complacency.  His anxiety for Jane was\\r\\nevident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\r\\nprevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she\\r\\nbelieved she was considered by the others. She had very little\\r\\nnotice from any but him.  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom\\r\\nElizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat,\\r\\ndrink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a\\r\\nplain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\r\\nBingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.\\r\\nHer manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture\\r\\nof pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no\\r\\nbeauty.  Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\r\\nexcellent walker.  I shall never forget her appearance this\\r\\nmorning.  She really looked almost wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa.  I could hardly keep my countenance.\\r\\nVery nonsensical to come at all!  Why must SHE be scampering\\r\\nabout the country, because her sister had a cold?  Her hair, so\\r\\nuntidy, so blowsy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\r\\ndeep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had\\r\\nbeen let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but\\r\\nthis was all lost upon me.  I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\r\\nlooked remarkably well when she came into the room this\\r\\nmorning.  Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley;\\r\\n\"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see\\r\\nYOUR sister make such an exhibition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it\\r\\nis, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!  What could\\r\\nshe mean by it?  It seems to me to show an abominable sort of\\r\\nconceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\r\\ndecorum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\\r\\nBingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half\\r\\nwhisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your\\r\\nadmiration of her fine eyes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"\\r\\nA short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\r\\nvery sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\r\\nsettled.  But with such a father and mother, and such low\\r\\nconnections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on\\r\\nMeryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near\\r\\nCheapside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed\\r\\nheartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,\" cried\\r\\nBingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\r\\nof any consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\r\\ntheir hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the\\r\\nexpense of their dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her\\r\\nroom on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till\\r\\nsummoned to coffee.  She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth\\r\\nwould not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had\\r\\nthe comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather\\r\\nright than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.  On\\r\\nentering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and\\r\\nwas immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\r\\nplaying high, she declined it, for the short time she could stay\\r\\nbelow, with a book.  Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather\\r\\nsingular.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a\\r\\ngreat reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\"said\\r\\nBingley; \"and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite\\r\\nwell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards\\r\\nthe table where a few books were lying.  He immediately offered\\r\\nto fetch her others-- all that his library afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my\\r\\nown credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many,\\r\\nI have more than I ever looked into.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\r\\nthose in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should\\r\\nhave left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\r\\nyou have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\\r\\ngenerations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are\\r\\nalways buying books.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\r\\nas these.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neglect!  I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\r\\nbeauties of that noble place.  Charles, when you build YOUR\\r\\nhouse, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\r\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.  There\\r\\nis not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\r\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her\\r\\nvery little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside,\\r\\nshe drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.\\r\\nBingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think she will.  She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s\\r\\nheight, or rather taller.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\r\\ndelighted me so much.  Such a countenance, such manners!  And\\r\\nso extremely accomplished for her age!  Her performance on the\\r\\npianoforte is exquisite.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have\\r\\npatience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\r\\nmean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think.  They all paint tables, cover screens,\\r\\nand net purses.  I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this,\\r\\nand I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\r\\ntime, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a\\r\\nwoman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or\\r\\ncovering a screen.  But I am very far from agreeing with you in\\r\\nyour estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing\\r\\nmore than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance,\\r\\nthat are really accomplished.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal\\r\\nin your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\\r\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\r\\nusually met with.  A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\r\\nmusic, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\r\\ndeserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain\\r\\nsomething in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her\\r\\nvoice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\r\\nhalf-deserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she\\r\\nmust yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\r\\nher mind by extensive reading.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six\\r\\naccomplished women.  I rather wonder now at your knowing\\r\\nANY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the\\r\\npossibility of all this?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw such a woman.  I never saw such capacity, and\\r\\ntaste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\r\\nof her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\r\\nmany women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst\\r\\ncalled them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention\\r\\nto what was going forward.  As all conversation was thereby at\\r\\nan end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was\\r\\nclosed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to\\r\\nrecommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their\\r\\nown; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.  But, in my\\r\\nopinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\r\\naddressed, \"there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies\\r\\nsometimes condescend to employ for captivation.  Whatever\\r\\nbears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\r\\ncontinue the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\r\\nworse, and that she could not leave her.  Bingley urged Mr.\\r\\nJones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced\\r\\nthat no country advice could be of any service, recommended an\\r\\nexpress to town for one of the most eminent physicians.  This\\r\\nshe would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply\\r\\nwith their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones\\r\\nshould be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not\\r\\ndecidedly better.  Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\r\\ndeclared that they were miserable:  They solaced their\\r\\nwretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could\\r\\nfind no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper\\r\\ndirections that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and\\r\\nher sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\\'s room, and\\r\\nin the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\r\\nanswer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\r\\nBingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\r\\nelegant ladies who waited on his sisters.  In spite of this\\r\\namendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\r\\nLongbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\r\\njudgement of her situation.  The note was immediately\\r\\ndispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached\\r\\nNetherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would\\r\\nhave been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that\\r\\nher illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\r\\nimmediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\r\\nher from Netherfield.  She would not listen, therefore, to her\\r\\ndaughter\\'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\r\\napothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\r\\nadvisable.  After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\r\\nBingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\r\\ndaughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.  Bingley met\\r\\nthem with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\r\\nworse than she expected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill\\r\\nto be moved.  Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\r\\nWe must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley.  \"It must not be thought of.  My\\r\\nsister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon it, madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold\\r\\ncivility, \"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention\\r\\nwhile she remains with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do\\r\\nnot know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\r\\nand suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\r\\nworld, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\r\\nexception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.  I often tell\\r\\nmy other girls they are nothing to HER. You have a sweet room\\r\\nhere, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel\\r\\nwalk.  I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\r\\nNetherfield.  You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope,\\r\\nthough you have but a short lease.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\\r\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\r\\nfive minutes.  At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\r\\nfixed here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning\\r\\ntowards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- I understand you perfectly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily\\r\\nseen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is as it happens.  It does not follow that a deep, intricate\\r\\ncharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not\\r\\nrun on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that\\r\\nyour were a studier of character.  It must be an amusing study.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing.  They\\r\\nhave at least that advantage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few\\r\\nsubjects for such a study.  In a country neighbourhood you move\\r\\nin a very confined and unvarying society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something\\r\\nnew to be observed in them for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of\\r\\nmentioning a country neighbourhood.  \"I assure you there is\\r\\nquite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\r\\nmoment, turned silently away.  Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she\\r\\nhad gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\\r\\ncountry, for my part, except the shops and public places.  The\\r\\ncountry is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\\r\\nand when I am in town it is pretty much the same.  They have\\r\\neach their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye-- that is because you have the right disposition.  But that\\r\\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was\\r\\nnothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for\\r\\nher mother.  \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.  He only meant that\\r\\nthere was not such a variety of people to be met with in the\\r\\ncountry as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be\\r\\ntrue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\\r\\nmeeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there\\r\\nare few neighbourhoods larger.  I know we dine with\\r\\nfour-and-twenty families.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\r\\nhis countenance.  His sister was less delicate, and directed her\\r\\neyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nfor the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\'s\\r\\nthoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at\\r\\nLongbourn since HER coming away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.  What an agreeable\\r\\nman Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?  So much the man of\\r\\nfashion!  So genteel and easy!  He had always something to say\\r\\nto everybody.  THAT is my idea of good breeding; and those\\r\\npersons who fancy themselves very important, and never open\\r\\ntheir mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, she would go home.  I fancy she was wanted about\\r\\nmince-pies.  For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants\\r\\nthat can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up very\\r\\ndifferently.  But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\r\\nLucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.  It is a pity\\r\\nthey are not handsome!  Not that I think Charlotte so VERY\\r\\nplain-- but then she is our particular friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nherself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty.  I do not\\r\\nlike to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane-- one does\\r\\nnot often see anybody better looking.  It is what everybody says.\\r\\nI do not trust my own partiality.  When she was only fifteen,\\r\\nthere was a man at my brother Gardiner\\'s in town so much in\\r\\nlove with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her\\r\\nan offer before we came away.  But, however, he did not.\\r\\nPerhaps he thought her too young.  However, he wrote some\\r\\nverses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently.  \"There\\r\\nhas been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.  I\\r\\nwonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving\\r\\naway love!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love,\" said\\r\\nDarcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of  a fine, stout, healthy love it may.  Everything nourishes\\r\\nwhat is strong already.  But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\r\\ninclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\r\\nentirely away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\r\\nElizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\r\\nagain.  She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\r\\nand after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\r\\ntroubling him also with Lizzy.  Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly\\r\\ncivil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\r\\nand say what the occasion required.  She performed her part\\r\\nindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was\\r\\nsatisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.  Upon this\\r\\nsignal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.  The\\r\\ntwo girls had been whispering to each other during the whole\\r\\nvisit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.\\r\\nBingley with having promised on his first coming into the\\r\\ncountry to give a ball at Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\r\\ncomplexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with\\r\\nher mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an\\r\\nearly age.  She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\r\\nself-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom\\r\\nher uncle\\'s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended\\r\\nher, had increased into assurance.  She was very equal,\\r\\ntherefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\\r\\nabruptly reminded him that it would be the most shameful thing\\r\\nin the world if he did not keep it.  His answer to this sudden\\r\\nattack was delightful to her mother\\'s ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\r\\nwhen your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\r\\nvery day of the ball.  But you would not wish to be dancing\\r\\nwhen she is ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia declared herself satisfied.  \"Oh! yes-- it would be much\\r\\nbetter to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\r\\nCaptain Carter would be at Meryton again.  And when you have\\r\\ngiven YOUR ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their giving one\\r\\nalso.  I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he\\r\\ndoes not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and her daughter then departed, and Elizabeth\\r\\nreturned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\'\\r\\nbehaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the\\r\\nlatter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in\\r\\ntheir censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on\\r\\nFINE EYES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day passed much as the day before had done.  Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\\r\\ninvalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\\r\\nevening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.  The\\r\\nloo-table, however, did not appear.  Mr. Darcy was writing, and\\r\\nMiss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\\r\\nletter and repeatedly calling his attention by messages to his\\r\\nsister.  Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst was observing their game.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently\\r\\namused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his\\r\\ncompanion.  The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on\\r\\nhis handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length\\r\\nof his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises\\r\\nwere received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in\\r\\nunion with her opinion of each.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken.  I write rather slowly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the\\r\\ncourse of a year!  Letters of business, too!  How odious I should\\r\\nthink them!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen.  Let me mend it for you.  I\\r\\nmend pens remarkably well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you-- but I always mend my own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\\r\\nthe harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\\r\\nher beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely\\r\\nsuperior to Miss Grantley\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?\\r\\nAt present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  It is of no consequence.  I shall see her in January.  But do\\r\\nyou always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not\\r\\nfor me to determine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\\r\\nwith ease, cannot write ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried\\r\\nher brother, \"because he does not write with ease.  He studies\\r\\ntoo much for words of four syllables.  Do not you, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless\\r\\nway imaginable.  He leaves out half his words, and blots the\\r\\nrest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--\\r\\nby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to\\r\\nmy correspondents.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm\\r\\nreproof.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\\r\\nhumility.  It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\\r\\nan indirect boast.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of\\r\\nmodesty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\r\\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a\\r\\nrapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\\r\\nestimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of\\r\\ndoing anything with quickness is always prized much by the\\r\\npossessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\r\\nthe performance.  When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning, that\\r\\nif you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be\\r\\ngone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\\r\\ncompliment to yourself-- and yet what is there so very laudable\\r\\nin a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\r\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone\\r\\nelse?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all\\r\\nthe foolish things that were said in the morning.  And, yet, upon\\r\\nmy honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I\\r\\nbelieve it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume\\r\\nthe character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\\r\\nthe ladies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\r\\nyou would be gone with such celerity.  Your conduct would be\\r\\nquite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if,\\r\\nas you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say,  \\'Bingley,\\r\\nyou had better stay till next week,\\' you would probably do it,\\r\\nyou would probably not go-- and at another word, might stay a\\r\\nmonth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr.\\r\\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition.  You have\\r\\nshown him off now much more than he did himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting\\r\\nwhat my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\\r\\ntemper.  But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\\r\\ngentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\\r\\nbetter of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\\r\\ndenial, and ride off as fast as I could.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\\r\\nintentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must\\r\\nspeak for himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to\\r\\ncall mine, but which I have never acknowledged.  Allowing the\\r\\ncase, however, to stand according to your representation, you\\r\\nmust remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to\\r\\ndesire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has\\r\\nmerely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in\\r\\nfavour of its propriety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield readily-- easily-- to the PERSUASION of a friend is\\r\\nno merit with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\\r\\nunderstanding of either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the\\r\\ninfluence of friendship and affection.  A regard for the requester\\r\\nwould often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting\\r\\nfor arguments to reason one into it.  I am not particularly\\r\\nspeaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.\\r\\nBingley.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance\\r\\noccurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\r\\nthereupon.  But in general and ordinary cases between friend and\\r\\nfriend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a\\r\\nresolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that\\r\\nperson for complying with the desire, without waiting to be\\r\\nargued into it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\r\\narrange with rather more precision the degree of importance\\r\\nwhich is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\\r\\nintimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\\r\\nforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have\\r\\nmore weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\\r\\naware of.  I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall\\r\\nfellow, in comparison with myself, that I should not pay him half\\r\\nso much deference.  I declare I do not know a more awful object\\r\\nthan Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at\\r\\nhis own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\\r\\nnothing to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\\r\\nhe was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.  Miss\\r\\nBingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\\r\\nexpostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend.  \"You dislike an\\r\\nargument, and want to silence this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps I do.  Arguments are too much like disputes.  If you\\r\\nand Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\\r\\nbe very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\\r\\nElizabeth for an indulgence of some music.  Miss Bingley moved\\r\\nwith some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request\\r\\nthat Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely\\r\\nand more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\\r\\nemployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned\\r\\nover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how\\r\\nfrequently Mr. Darcy\\'s eyes were fixed on her.  She hardly knew\\r\\nhow to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so\\r\\ngreat a man; and yet that he should look at her because he\\r\\ndisliked her, was still more strange.  She could only imagine,\\r\\nhowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was\\r\\nsomething more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas\\r\\nof right, than in any other person present.  The supposition did\\r\\nnot pain her.  She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\\r\\nby a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\\r\\nnear Elizabeth, said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\\r\\nan opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled, but made no answer.  He repeated the question, with\\r\\nsome surprise at her silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\r\\ndetermine what to say in reply.  You wanted me, I know, to say\\r\\n\\'Yes,\\' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\\r\\nbut I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and\\r\\ncheating a person of their meditated contempt.  I have,\\r\\ntherefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\\r\\ndance a reel at all-- and now despise me if you dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\\r\\nhis gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\\r\\nin her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\\r\\nand Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he\\r\\nwas by her.  He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority\\r\\nof her connections, he should be in some danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\\r\\ngreat anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\\r\\nsome assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\\r\\ntalking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\\r\\nsuch an alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the\\r\\nshrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few\\r\\nhints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\\r\\nof holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the\\r\\nyounger girls of running after officers.  And, if I may mention so\\r\\ndelicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\\r\\nbordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\\r\\npossesses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes.  Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips get\\r\\nplaced in the gallery at Pemberley.  Put them next to your\\r\\ngreat-uncle the judge.  They are in the same profession, you\\r\\nknow, only in different lines.  As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you\\r\\nmust not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those\\r\\nbeautiful eyes?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\\r\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might\\r\\nbe copied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst\\r\\nand Elizabeth herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss Bingley,\\r\\nin some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You used us abominably ill, \"answered Mrs. Hurst, \"running\\r\\naway without telling us that you were coming out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\\r\\nto walk by herself.  The path just admitted three.  Mr. Darcy felt\\r\\ntheir rudeness, and immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party.  We had better go\\r\\ninto the avenue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\\r\\nthem, laughingly answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no; stay where you are.  You are charmingly grouped, and\\r\\nappear to uncommon advantage.  The picturesque would be\\r\\nspoilt by admitting a fourth.  Good-bye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the\\r\\nhope of being at home again in a day or two.  Jane was already\\r\\nso much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\\r\\nhours that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 11\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\r\\nsister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into\\r\\nthe drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends\\r\\nwith many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen\\r\\nthem so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed\\r\\nbefore the gentlemen appeared.  Their powers of conversation\\r\\nwere considerable.  They could describe an entertainment with\\r\\naccuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\r\\nacquaintance with spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first\\r\\nobject; Miss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,\\r\\nand she had something to say to him before he had advanced\\r\\nmany steps.  He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite\\r\\ncongratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said\\r\\nhe was \"very glad\"; but diffuseness and warmth remained for\\r\\nBingley\\'s salutation.  He was full of joy and attention.  The first\\r\\nhalf-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\r\\nfrom the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the\\r\\nother side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the\\r\\ndoor.  He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\r\\nelse.  Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with\\r\\ngreat delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\r\\ncard-table-- but in vain.  She had obtained private intelligence\\r\\nthat Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found\\r\\neven his open petition rejected.  She assured him that no one\\r\\nintended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the\\r\\nsubject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to\\r\\ndo, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\r\\nDarcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.\\r\\nHurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\r\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with\\r\\nMiss Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s progress through HIS book, as in reading her own;\\r\\nand she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking\\r\\nat his page.  She could not win him, however, to any\\r\\nconversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.  At\\r\\nlength, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her\\r\\nown book, which she had only chosen because it was the second\\r\\nvolume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\\r\\nis to spend an evening in this way!  I declare after all there is no\\r\\nenjoyment like reading!  How much sooner one tires of anything\\r\\nthan of a book!  When I have a house of my own, I shall be\\r\\nmiserable if I have not an excellent library.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one made any reply.  She then yawned again, threw aside her\\r\\nbook, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\r\\namusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\r\\nBennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance\\r\\nat Netherfield?  I would advise you, before you determine on it,\\r\\nto consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if\\r\\nthere are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a\\r\\npunishment than a pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\\r\\nchooses, before it begins-- but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\r\\nthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I\\r\\nshall send round my cards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\\r\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something\\r\\ninsufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.  It\\r\\nwould surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\r\\ndancing were made the order of the day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\r\\nnot be near so much like a ball.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up\\r\\nand walked about the room.  Her figure was elegant, and she\\r\\nwalked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still\\r\\ninflexibly studious.  In the desperation of her feelings, she\\r\\nresolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,\\r\\nand take a turn about the room.  I assure you it is very refreshing\\r\\nafter sitting so long in one attitude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.  Miss\\r\\nBingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\r\\nDarcy looked up.  He was as much awake to the novelty of\\r\\nattention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and\\r\\nunconsciously closed his book.  He was directly invited to join\\r\\ntheir party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine\\r\\nbut two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the\\r\\nroom together, with either of which motives his joining them\\r\\nwould interfere.  \"What could he mean?  She was dying to know\\r\\nwhat could be his meaning?\"-- and asked Elizabeth whether she\\r\\ncould at all understand him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to\\r\\nbe severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be\\r\\nto ask nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.\\r\\nDarcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an\\r\\nexplanation of his two motives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he,\\r\\nas soon as she allowed him to speak.  \"You either choose this\\r\\nmethod of passing the evening because you are in each other\\'s\\r\\nconfidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are\\r\\nconscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in\\r\\nwalking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if\\r\\nthe second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley.  \"I never heard anything so\\r\\nabominable.  How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\"We can all plague and punish one another.  Tease him-- laugh\\r\\nat him.  Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be\\r\\ndone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But upon my honour, I do NOT.  I do assure you that my\\r\\nintimacy has not yet taught me THAT.  Tease calmness of\\r\\nmanner and presence of mind!  No, no-- feel he may defy us\\r\\nthere.  And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you\\r\\nplease, by attempting to laugh without a subject.  Mr. Darcy may\\r\\nhug himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"That is an\\r\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue,\\r\\nfor it would be a great loss to ME to have many such\\r\\nacquaintances.  I dearly love a laugh.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\r\\nThe wisest and the best of men-- nay, the wisest and best of their\\r\\nactions-- may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first\\r\\nobject in life is a joke.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth-- \"there are such people, but I\\r\\nhope I am not one of THEM.  I hope I never ridicule what is\\r\\nwise and good.  Follies and nonsense, whims and\\r\\ninconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them\\r\\nwhenever I can.  But these, I suppose, are precisely what you\\r\\nare without.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.  But it has been the\\r\\nstudy of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a\\r\\nstrong understanding to ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.  But pride-- where there is a\\r\\nreal superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\\r\\nregulation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss\\r\\nBingley; \"and pray what is the result?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.\\r\\nHe owns it himself without disguise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension.  I have\\r\\nfaults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.  My\\r\\ntemper I dare not vouch for.  It is, I believe, too little yielding--\\r\\ncertainly too little for the convenience of the world.  I cannot\\r\\nforget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their\\r\\noffenses against myself.  My feelings are not puffed about with\\r\\nevery attempt to move them.  My temper would perhaps be\\r\\ncalled resentful.  My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable\\r\\nresentment IS a shade in a character.  But you have chosen your\\r\\nfault well.  I really cannot LAUGH at it.  You are safe from me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some\\r\\nparticular evil-- a natural defect, which not even the best\\r\\neducation can overcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yours, \"he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to\\r\\nmisunderstand them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\r\\nconversation in which she had no share.  \"Louisa, you will not\\r\\nmind my waking Mr. Hurst?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\r\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments\\' recollection, was not\\r\\nsorry for it.  He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too\\r\\nmuch attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 12\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\\r\\nwrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage\\r\\nmight be sent for them in the course of the day.  But Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at\\r\\nNetherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly\\r\\nfinish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with\\r\\npleasure before.  Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\r\\nleast not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get\\r\\nhome.  Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly\\r\\nhave the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was\\r\\nadded, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay\\r\\nlonger, she could spare them very well.  Against staying longer,\\r\\nhowever, Elizabeth was positively resolved-- nor did she much\\r\\nexpect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being\\r\\nconsidered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged\\r\\nJane to borrow Mr. Bingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at\\r\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving\\r\\nNetherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and\\r\\nenough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the\\r\\nfollowing day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going\\r\\nwas deferred.  Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had\\r\\nproposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister\\r\\nmuch exceeded her affection for the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were\\r\\nto go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that\\r\\nit would not be safe for her-- that she was not enough recovered;\\r\\nbut Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence-- Elizabeth had been\\r\\nat Netherfield long enough.  She attracted him more than he\\r\\nliked-- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more teasing\\r\\nthan usual to himself.  He wisely resolved to be particularly\\r\\ncareful that no sign of admiration should NOW escape him,\\r\\nnothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his\\r\\nfelicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his\\r\\nbehaviour during the last day must have material weight in\\r\\nconfirming or crushing it.  Steady to his purpose, he scarcely\\r\\nspoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and\\r\\nthough they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour,\\r\\nhe adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not\\r\\neven look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable\\r\\nto almost all, took place.  Miss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth\\r\\nincreased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane;\\r\\nand when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it\\r\\nwould always give her to see her either at Longbourn or\\r\\nNetherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook\\r\\nhands with the former.  Elizabeth took leave of the whole party\\r\\nin the liveliest of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very\\r\\nwrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have\\r\\ncaught cold again.  But their father, though very laconic in his\\r\\nexpressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt\\r\\ntheir importance in the family circle.  The evening conversation,\\r\\nwhen they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation,\\r\\nand almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass\\r\\nand human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some\\r\\nnew observations of threadbare morality to listen to.  Catherine\\r\\nand Lydia had information for them of a different sort.  Much\\r\\nhad been done and much had been said in the regiment since the\\r\\npreceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately\\r\\nwith their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually\\r\\nbeen hinted that colonel Foster was going to be married.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 13\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\r\\nbreakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good\\r\\ndinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our\\r\\nfamily party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear?  I know of nobody that is coming,\\r\\nI am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in-- And\\r\\nI hope MY dinners are good enough for her.  I do not believe\\r\\nshe often sees such at home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s eyes sparkled.  \"A gentleman and a stranger!  It is\\r\\nMr. Bingley, I am sure!  Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\\r\\nto see Mr. Bingley.  But--good Lord! how unlucky!  There is not\\r\\na bit of fish to be got to-day.  Lydia, my love, ring the bell-- I\\r\\nmust speak to Hill this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is NOT Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person whom\\r\\nI never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\\r\\nbeing eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\r\\nexplained:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\\r\\nago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\\r\\nrequiring early attention.  It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\\r\\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\\r\\npleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that\\r\\nmentioned.  Pray do not talk of that odious man.  I do think it is\\r\\nthe hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed\\r\\naway from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I\\r\\nshould have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\r\\nThey had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on\\r\\nwhich Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she\\r\\ncontinued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling and estate\\r\\naway from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom\\r\\nnobody cared anything about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and\\r\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\\r\\nLongbourn.  But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\\r\\nbe a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent\\r\\nof him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.  I hate such\\r\\nfalse friends.  Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as\\r\\nhis father did before him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\\r\\nthat head, as you will hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                      \"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,\\r\\n                                                   \"15th October.\\r\\n\"Dear Sir,--\\r\\n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\\r\\nhonoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I\\r\\nhave had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to\\r\\nheal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own\\r\\ndoubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for\\r\\nme to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always\\r\\npleased him to be at variance,--  \\'There, Mrs. Bennet.\\'-- My\\r\\nmind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\r\\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\r\\ndistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose\\r\\nbounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory\\r\\nof this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean\\r\\nmyself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever\\r\\nready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted\\r\\nby the Church of England.  As a clergyman,  moreover, I feel it\\r\\nmy duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all\\r\\nfamilies within in the reach of my influence; and on these\\r\\ngrounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly\\r\\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the\\r\\nentail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\\r\\nside, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.  I\\r\\ncannot otherwise than be concerned at being the means of\\r\\ninjuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\\r\\nit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every\\r\\npossible amends-- but of this hereafter.  If you should have no\\r\\nobjection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the\\r\\nsatisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,\\r\\nNovember 18th, by four o\\'clock, and shall probably trespass on\\r\\nyour hospitality till the Saturday se\\'ennight following, which I\\r\\ncan do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from\\r\\nobjecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that\\r\\nsome other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.-- I\\r\\nremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\\r\\ndaughters, your well-wisher and friend,\\r\\n                                   \"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\\r\\ngentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.  \"He\\r\\nseems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon\\r\\nmy word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\\r\\nespecially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him\\r\\ncome to us again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\\r\\nand if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the\\r\\nperson to discourage him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he can\\r\\nmean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\\r\\ncertainly to his credit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\\r\\nLady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\\r\\nand burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she.  \"I cannot make him\\r\\nout.  There is something very pompous in his style.  And what\\r\\ncan he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?  We\\r\\ncannot suppose he would help it if he could.  Could he be a\\r\\nsensible man, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my dear, I think not.  I have great hopes of finding him\\r\\nquite the reverse.  Thee is a mixture of servility and\\r\\nself-importance in his letter, which promises well.  I am\\r\\nimpatient to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not seem\\r\\ndefective.  The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\\r\\nnew, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in\\r\\nany degree interesting.  It was next to impossible that their\\r\\ncousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some\\r\\nweeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a\\r\\nman in any other colour.  As for their mother, Mr. Collins\\'s letter\\r\\nhad done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see\\r\\nhim with a degree of composure which astonished her husband\\r\\nand daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with\\r\\ngreat politeness by the whole family.  Mr. Bennet indeed said\\r\\nlittle; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins\\r\\nseemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be\\r\\nsilent himself.  He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\\r\\nfive-and-twenty.  His air was grave and stately, and his manners\\r\\nwere very formal. He had not been long seated before he\\r\\ncomplimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\r\\ndaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in\\r\\nthis instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that\\r\\nhe did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in\\r\\nmarriage.  This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of\\r\\nhis hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no\\r\\ncompliments, answered most readily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\\r\\nmay prove so, for else they will be destitute enough.  Things are\\r\\nsettled so oddly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed.  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\\r\\nmust confess.  Not that I mean to find fault with YOU, for such\\r\\nthings I know are all chance in this world.  There is no knowing\\r\\nhow estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\\r\\nand could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\\r\\nappearing forward and precipitate.  But I can assure the young\\r\\nladies that I come prepared to admire them.  At present I will\\r\\nnot say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\\r\\non each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collin\\'s\\r\\nadmiration.  The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were\\r\\nexamined and praised; and his commendation of everything\\r\\nwould have touched Mrs. Bennet\\'s heart, but for the mortifying\\r\\nsupposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.  The\\r\\ndinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to\\r\\nknow to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking\\r\\nwas owing.  But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\r\\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to\\r\\nkeep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in\\r\\nthe kitchen.  He begged pardon for having displeased her.  In a\\r\\nsoftened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he\\r\\ncontinued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the\\r\\nservants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some\\r\\nconversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\\r\\nwhich he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed\\r\\nvery fortunate in his patroness.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\'s\\r\\nattention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort,\\r\\nappeared very remarkable.  Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\r\\nbetter.  Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.  The subject\\r\\nelevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a\\r\\nmost important aspect he protested that \"he had never in his life\\r\\nwitnessed such behaviour in a person of rank-- such affability\\r\\nand condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  She had been graciously pleased to approve of both\\r\\nof the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\r\\npreaching before her.  She had also asked him twice to dine at\\r\\nRosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make\\r\\nup her pool of quadrille in the evening.  Lady Catherine was\\r\\nreckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never\\r\\nseen anything but affability in her.  She had always spoken to\\r\\nhim as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the\\r\\nsmallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\r\\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a\\r\\nweek or two, to visit his relations.  She had even condescended\\r\\nto advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose\\r\\nwith discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble\\r\\nparsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\r\\nhe had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\\r\\nherself-- some shelves in the closet upstairs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.  It is a pity that\\r\\ngreat ladies in general are not more like her.  Does she live near\\r\\nyou, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only\\r\\nby a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir?  Has she any family?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\r\\nextensive property.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off\\r\\nthan many girls.  And what sort of young lady is she?  Is she\\r\\nhandsome?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine\\r\\nherself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far\\r\\nsuperior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in\\r\\nher features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\r\\nShe is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented\\r\\nher from making that progress in many accomplishments which\\r\\nshe could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the\\r\\nlady who superintended her education, and who still resides with\\r\\nthem.  But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to\\r\\ndrive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among\\r\\nthe ladies at court.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\\r\\ntown; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has\\r\\ndeprived the British court of its brightest ornaments.  Her\\r\\nladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that\\r\\nI am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate\\r\\ncompliments which are always acceptable to ladies.  I have more\\r\\nthan once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming\\r\\ndaughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\r\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be\\r\\nadorned by her.  These are the kind of little things which please\\r\\nher ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself\\r\\npeculiarly bound to pay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for\\r\\nyou that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.  May I\\r\\nask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse\\r\\nof the moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though\\r\\nI sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such\\r\\nlittle elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary\\r\\noccasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s expectations were fully answered.  His cousin was\\r\\nas absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the\\r\\nkeenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most\\r\\nresolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional\\r\\nglance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr.\\r\\nBennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again,\\r\\nand, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the\\r\\nladies.  Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced;\\r\\nbut, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a\\r\\ncirculating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\r\\nprotested that he never read novels.  Kitty stared at him, and\\r\\nLydia exclaimed.  Other books were produced, and after some\\r\\ndeliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons.  Lydia gaped as he\\r\\nopened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous\\r\\nsolemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning\\r\\naway Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.  My\\r\\naunt told me so herself on Saturday.  I shall walk to Meryton\\r\\nto-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny\\r\\ncomes back from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but\\r\\nMr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\\r\\nbooks of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.\\r\\nIt amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so\\r\\nadvantageous to them as instruction.  But I will no longer\\r\\nimportune my young cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist\\r\\nat backgammon.  Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing\\r\\nthat he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling\\r\\namusements.  Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most\\r\\ncivilly for Lydia\\'s interruption, and promised that it should not\\r\\noccur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after\\r\\nassuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and\\r\\nshould never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself\\r\\nat another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for\\r\\nbackgammon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature\\r\\nhad been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest\\r\\npart of his life having been spent under the guidance of an\\r\\nilliterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of\\r\\nthe universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without\\r\\nforming at it any useful acquaintance.  The subjection in which\\r\\nhis father had brought him up had given him originally great\\r\\nhumility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by\\r\\nthe self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the\\r\\nconsequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.  A\\r\\nfortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\r\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect\\r\\nwhich he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his\\r\\npatroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his\\r\\nauthority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him\\r\\naltogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness,\\r\\nself-importance and humility.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he\\r\\nintended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the\\r\\nLongbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose\\r\\none of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable\\r\\nas they were represented by common report.  This was his plan\\r\\noff amends-- of atonement-- for inheriting their father\\'s estate;\\r\\nand he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\r\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his\\r\\nown part.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.  Miss Bennet\\'s lovely face\\r\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of\\r\\nwhat was due to seniority; and for the first evening SHE was his\\r\\nsettled choice.  The next morning, however, made an alteration;\\r\\nfor in a quarter of an hour\\'s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before\\r\\nbreakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house,\\r\\nand leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress\\r\\nmight be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid\\r\\nvery complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution\\r\\nagainst the very Jane he had fixed on.  \"As to her YOUNGER\\r\\ndaughters, she could not take upon her to say-- she could not\\r\\npositively answer-- but she did not KNOW of any prepossession;\\r\\nher ELDEST daughter, she must just mention-- she felt it\\r\\nincumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth-- and it\\r\\nwas soon done-- done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\\r\\nElizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded\\r\\nher of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might\\r\\nsoon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could\\r\\nnot bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good\\r\\ngraces.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten;\\r\\nevery sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most\\r\\nanxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for\\r\\nthither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he\\r\\nwould continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios\\r\\nin the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little\\r\\ncessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.  Such doings\\r\\ndiscomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.  In his library he had been\\r\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as\\r\\nhe told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other\\r\\nroom of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\\r\\ncivility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to\\r\\njoin his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact\\r\\nmuch better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely\\r\\npleased to close his large book, and go.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\r\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.  The\\r\\nattention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by\\r\\nhim.  Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in\\r\\nquest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet\\r\\nindeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\\r\\nwhom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike\\r\\nappearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the\\r\\nway.  The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose\\r\\nreturn from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as\\r\\nthey passed.  All were struck with the stranger\\'s air, all\\r\\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if\\r\\npossible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense\\r\\nof wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had\\r\\njust gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back,\\r\\nhad reached the same spot.  Mr. Denny addressed them directly,\\r\\nand entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nwho had returned with him the day before from town, and he\\r\\nwas happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.\\r\\nThis was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only\\r\\nregimentals to make him completely charming.  His appearance\\r\\nwas greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a\\r\\nfine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.  The\\r\\nintroduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of\\r\\nconversation-- a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\r\\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking\\r\\ntogether very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their\\r\\nnotice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.\\r\\nOn distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen\\r\\ncame directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.\\r\\nBingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\r\\nprincipal object.  He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn\\r\\non purpose to inquire after her.  Mr. Darcy corroborated it with\\r\\na bow, an was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on\\r\\nElizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\r\\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of\\r\\nboth as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the\\r\\neffect of the meeting.  Both changed colour, one looked white,\\r\\nthe other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his\\r\\nhat-- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What\\r\\ncould be the meaning of it?  It was impossible to imagine; it was\\r\\nimpossible not to long to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have\\r\\nnoticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to\\r\\nthe door of Mr. Phillip\\'s house, and then made their bows, in\\r\\nspite of Miss Lydia\\'s pressing entreaties that they should come\\r\\nin, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips\\'s throwing up the parlour\\r\\nwindow and loudly seconding the invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two\\r\\neldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and\\r\\nshe was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return\\r\\nhome, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she\\r\\nshould have known nothing about, if she had not happened to\\r\\nsee Mr. Jones\\'s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that\\r\\nthey were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because\\r\\nthe Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was\\r\\nclaimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\\'s introduction of him.  She\\r\\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned\\r\\nwith as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any\\r\\nprevious acquaintance with her, which he could not help\\r\\nflattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship\\r\\nto the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.  Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but\\r\\nher contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by\\r\\nexclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however,\\r\\nshe could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.\\r\\nDenny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\r\\nlieutenant\\'s commission in the ----shire.  She had been watching\\r\\nhim the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,\\r\\nand had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly\\r\\nhave continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed\\r\\nwindows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison\\r\\nwith the stranger, were become \"stupid, disagreeable fellows.\"\\r\\nSome of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and\\r\\ntheir aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nand give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\r\\nwould come in the evening.  This was agreed to, and Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy\\r\\ngame of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.\\r\\nThe prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted\\r\\nin mutual good spirits.  Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in\\r\\nquitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that\\r\\nthey were perfectly needless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had\\r\\nseen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would\\r\\nhave defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the\\r\\nwrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by\\r\\nadmiring Mrs. Phillips\\'s manners and politeness.  He protested\\r\\nthat, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen\\r\\na more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with\\r\\nthe utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her\\r\\ninvitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her\\r\\nbefore.  Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\r\\nconnection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\\r\\nattention in the whole course of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs no objection was made to the young people\\'s engagement\\r\\nwith their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\\r\\nsteadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at\\r\\na suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\\r\\nhearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nhad accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their\\r\\nseats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\\r\\nand he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\\r\\napartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed\\r\\nhimself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a\\r\\ncomparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but\\r\\nwhen Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and\\r\\nwho was its proprietor-- when she had listened to the description\\r\\nof only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found that\\r\\nthe chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt\\r\\nall the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented\\r\\na comparison with the housekeeper\\'s room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\\r\\nmansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\\r\\nabode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\\r\\nemployed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his\\r\\nconsequence increased with what she heard, and who was\\r\\nresolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she\\r\\ncould.  To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and\\r\\nwho had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and\\r\\nexamine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\\r\\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.  It was\\r\\nover at last, however.  The gentlemen did approach, and when\\r\\nMr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had\\r\\nneither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with\\r\\nthe smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of\\r\\nthe ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set,\\r\\nand the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.\\r\\nWickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air,\\r\\nand walk, as THEY were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy\\r\\nuncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every\\r\\nfemale eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by\\r\\nwhom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in\\r\\nwhich he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only\\r\\non its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest,\\r\\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by\\r\\nthe skill of the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\\r\\nthe officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\\r\\nthe young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\\r\\nintervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\\r\\nwatchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\r\\nWhen the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\\r\\nobliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be\\r\\nglad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nwas very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his\\r\\nreason.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\r\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.  At first\\r\\nthere seemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she\\r\\nwas a most determined talked; but being likewise extremely fond\\r\\nof lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\\r\\ngame, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\\r\\nhave attention for anyone in particular.  Allowing for the\\r\\ncommon demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at\\r\\nleisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\r\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\r\\ntold-- the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.  She dared\\r\\nnot even mention that gentleman.  Her curiosity, however, was\\r\\nunexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.\\r\\nHe inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after\\r\\nreceiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr.\\r\\nDarcy had been staying there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\\r\\nsubject drop, added, \"he is a man of very large property in\\r\\nDerbyshire, I understand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one.  A\\r\\nclear ten thousand per annum.  You could not have met with a\\r\\nperson more capable of giving you certain information on that\\r\\nhead than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a\\r\\nparticular manner from my infancy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\\r\\nafter seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\\r\\nmeeting yesterday.  Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly.  \"I\\r\\nhave spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him\\r\\nvery disagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no right to give MY opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his\\r\\nbeing agreeable or otherwise.  I am not qualified to form one.  I\\r\\nhave known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.  It is\\r\\nimpossible for ME to be impartial.  But I believe your opinion of\\r\\nhim would in general astonish-- and perhaps you would not\\r\\nexpress it quite so strongly anywhere else.  Here you are in your\\r\\nown family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in any\\r\\nhouse in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.  He is not at all\\r\\nliked in Hertfordshire.  Everybody is disgusted with his pride.\\r\\nYou will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\r\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated\\r\\nbeyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often\\r\\nhappen.  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence,\\r\\nor frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him\\r\\nonly as he chooses to be seen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\n ill-tempered man.\"  Wickham shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\\r\\n\"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going away\\r\\nwhen I was at Netherfield.  I hope your plans in favour of the\\r\\n----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no-- it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.  If\\r\\nHE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go.  We are not on\\r\\nfriendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\\r\\nhave no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim\\r\\nbefore all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\\r\\npainful regrets at his being what he is.  His father, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthe late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\\r\\nand the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\\r\\nwith this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\r\\nthousand tender recollections.  His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\\r\\ndisgracing  the memory of his father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened\\r\\nwith all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton,\\r\\nthe neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\\r\\nthat he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\\r\\nvery intelligible gallantry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he\\r\\nadded, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.  I\\r\\nknew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend\\r\\nDenny tempted me further by his account of their present\\r\\nquarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\\r\\nacquaintances Meryton had procured them.  Society, I own, is\\r\\nnecessary to me.  I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\\r\\nwill not bear solitude.  I MUST have employment and society.\\r\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\\r\\nhave now made it eligible.  The church OUGHT to have been\\r\\nmy profession-- I was brought up for the church, and I should at\\r\\nthis time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\\r\\npleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation\\r\\nof the best living in his gift.  He was my godfather, and\\r\\nexcessively attached to me.  I cannot do justice to his kindness.\\r\\nHe meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it;\\r\\nbut when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could THAT be?\\r\\nHow could his will be disregarded?  Why did you not seek legal\\r\\nredress?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\\r\\nas to give me no hope from law.  A man of honour could not\\r\\nhave doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it-- or\\r\\nto treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert\\r\\nthat I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--\\r\\nin short anything or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became\\r\\nvacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and\\r\\nthat it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I\\r\\ncannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve\\r\\nto lose it.  I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have\\r\\nspoken my opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely.  I can recall\\r\\nnothing worse.  But the fact is, that we are very different sort of\\r\\nmen, and that he hates me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is quite shocking!  He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some time or other he WILL be-- but it shall not be by ME.\\r\\nTill I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose HIM.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\\r\\nhandsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?\\r\\nWhat can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me-- a dislike which I cannot\\r\\nbut attribute in some measure to jealousy.  Had the late Mr.\\r\\nDarcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better;\\r\\nbut his father\\'s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I\\r\\nbelieve, very early in life.  He had not a temper to bear the sort of\\r\\ncompetition in which we stood-- the sort of preference which\\r\\nwas often given me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this-- though I have\\r\\nnever liked him.  I had not thought so very ill of him.  I had\\r\\nsupposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but\\r\\ndid not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge,\\r\\nsuch injustice, such inhumanity as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I DO\\r\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\\r\\nimplacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\\r\\ntemper.  His disposition must be dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\ncan hardly be just to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\\r\\n\"to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of\\r\\nhis father!\"  She could have added, \"a young man, too, like\\r\\nYOU, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\\r\\namiable\"-- but she contented herself with, \"and one, too, who\\r\\nhad probably been his companion from childhood, connected\\r\\ntogether, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\\r\\ngreatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\\r\\nsame house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\\r\\nparental care.  MY father began life in the profession which your\\r\\nuncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to-- but he\\r\\ngave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and\\r\\ndevoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.  He\\r\\nwas most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate,\\r\\nconfidential friend.  Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be\\r\\nunder the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active\\r\\nsuperintendence, and when, immediately before my father\\'s\\r\\ndeath, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for\\r\\nme, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of\\r\\ngratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"How abominable!  I wonder\\r\\nthat the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to\\r\\nyou!  If from no better motive, that he should not have been too\\r\\nproud to be dishonest-- for dishonesty I must call it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It IS wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions\\r\\nmay be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\r\\nIt has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\\r\\nfeeling.  But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\\r\\nto me there were stronger impulses even than pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes.  It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his\\r\\nmoney freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and\\r\\nrelieve the poor.  Family pride, and FILIAL pride-- for he is very\\r\\nproud of what his father was-- have done this.  Not to appear to\\r\\ndisgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or\\r\\nlose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.\\r\\nHe has also BROTHERLY pride, which, with SOME brotherly\\r\\naffection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his\\r\\nsister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most\\r\\nattentive and best of brothers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.  \"I wish I could call her amiable.  It gives me\\r\\npain to speak ill of a Darcy.  But she is too much like her\\r\\nbrother-- very, very proud.  As a child, she was affectionate and\\r\\npleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours\\r\\nand hours to her amusement.  But she is nothing to me now.\\r\\nShe is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I\\r\\nunderstand, highly accomplished.  Since her father\\'s death, her\\r\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\\r\\nsuperintends her education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!  How can Mr.\\r\\nBingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\\r\\ntruly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?  How can they\\r\\nsuit each other?  Do you know Mr. Bingley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.  He cannot\\r\\nknow what Mr. Darcy is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.  He\\r\\ndoes not want abilities.  He can be a conversible companion if he\\r\\nthinks it worth his while.  Among those who are at all his equals\\r\\nin consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\\r\\nless prosperous.  His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\\r\\nhe is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\\r\\nperhaps agreeable-- allowing something for fortune and figure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players\\r\\ngathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station\\r\\nbetween his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.  The usual\\r\\ninquiries as to his success was made by the latter.  It had not\\r\\nbeen very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nbegan to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with\\r\\nmuch earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that\\r\\nhe considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she\\r\\nwould not make herself uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down\\r\\nto a card table, they must take their chances of these things, and\\r\\nhappily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings\\r\\nany object.  There are undoubtedly many who could not say the\\r\\nsame, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed\\r\\nfar beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr,.\\r\\nCollins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\\r\\nwhether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\\r\\nfamily of de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given\\r\\nhim a living.  I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first\\r\\nintroduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her\\r\\nlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady\\r\\nAnne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the\\r\\npresent Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.  I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nconnections.  I never heard of her existence till the day before\\r\\nyesterday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\\r\\nand it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\\r\\nestates.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\\r\\nMiss Bingley.  Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\\r\\nuseless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he\\r\\nwere already self-destined for another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine\\r\\nand her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\\r\\nof her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in\\r\\nspite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited\\r\\nwoman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I\\r\\nhave not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that\\r\\nI never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\\r\\ninsolent.  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible\\r\\nand clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\\r\\nfrom her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\\r\\nand the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that\\r\\nevery one connected with him should have an understanding of\\r\\nthe first class.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it,\\r\\nand they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till\\r\\nsupper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their\\r\\nshare of Mr. Wickham\\'s attentions.  There could be no\\r\\nconversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\\'s supper party, but his\\r\\nmanners recommended him to everybody.  Whatever he said,\\r\\nwas said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwent away with her head full of him.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nbut of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way\\r\\nhome; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\r\\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.\\r\\nLydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost\\r\\nand the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the\\r\\ncivility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the\\r\\nleast regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at\\r\\nsupper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had\\r\\nmore to say than he could well manage before the carriage\\r\\nstopped at Longbourn House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between\\r\\nMr. Wickham and herself.  Jane listened with astonishment and\\r\\nconcern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be\\r\\nso unworthy of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her\\r\\nnature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable\\r\\nappearance as Wickham.  The possibility of his having endured\\r\\nsuch unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings;\\r\\nand nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of\\r\\nthem both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the\\r\\naccount of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise\\r\\nexplained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some\\r\\nway or other, of which we can form no idea.  Interested people\\r\\nhave perhaps misrepresented each to the other.  It is, in short,\\r\\nimpossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances\\r\\nwhich may have alienated them, without actual blame on either\\r\\nside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got\\r\\nto say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been\\r\\nconcerned in the business?  Do clear THEM too, or we shall be\\r\\nobliged to think ill of somebody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of\\r\\nmy opinion.  My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a\\r\\ndisgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\\'s\\r\\nfavourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to\\r\\nprovide for.  It is impossible.  No man of common humanity, no\\r\\nman who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.\\r\\nCan his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?\\r\\nOh! no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on,\\r\\nthan that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as\\r\\nhe gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned\\r\\nwithout ceremony.  If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.\\r\\nBesides, there was truth in his looks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is difficult indeed-- it is distressing.  One does not know what\\r\\nto think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point-- that Mr.\\r\\nBingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much to suffer\\r\\nwhen the affair became public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery,\\r\\nwhere this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very\\r\\npersons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his\\r\\nsisters came to give their personal invitation for the\\r\\nlong-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the\\r\\nfollowing Tuesday.  The two ladies were delighted to see their\\r\\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\\r\\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since\\r\\ntheir separation.  To the rest of the family they paid little\\r\\nattention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not\\r\\nmuch to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.  They were\\r\\nsoon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which\\r\\ntook their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to\\r\\nescape from Mrs. Bennet\\'s civilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to\\r\\nevery female of the family.  Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as\\r\\ngiven in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly\\r\\nflattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,\\r\\ninstead of a ceremonious card.  Jane pictured to herself a happy\\r\\nevening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of\\r\\nher brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a\\r\\ngreat deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of\\r\\neverything in Mr. Darcy\\'s look and behavior.  The happiness\\r\\nanticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\r\\nevent, or any particular person, for though they each, like\\r\\nElizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nhe was be no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and\\r\\na ball was, at any rate, a ball.  And even Mary could assure her\\r\\nfamily that she had no disinclination for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is\\r\\nenough-- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening\\r\\nengagements.  Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself\\r\\none of hose who consider intervals of recreation and amusement\\r\\nas desirable for everybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she\\r\\ndid not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not\\r\\nhelp asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\\'s\\r\\ninvitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join\\r\\nin the evening\\'s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find\\r\\nthat he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was\\r\\nvery far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a\\r\\nball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to\\r\\nrespectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far\\r\\nfrom objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\\r\\nhonoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of\\r\\nthe evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss\\r\\nElizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which\\r\\nI trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to\\r\\nany disrespect for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in.  She had fully\\r\\nproposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances;\\r\\nand to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been\\r\\nworse times.  There was no help for it, however.  Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little\\r\\nlonger, and Mr. Collins\\' proposal accepted with as good a grace\\r\\nas she could.  She was not better the pleased with his gallantry\\r\\nfrom the idea it suggested of something more.  It now first\\r\\nstruck her, that SHE was selected from among her sisters as\\r\\nworthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of\\r\\nassisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of\\r\\nmore eligible visitors.  The idea soon reached to conviction, as\\r\\nshe observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard\\r\\nhis frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and\\r\\nthough more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of\\r\\nher charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to\\r\\nunderstand that the probability of their marriage was extremely\\r\\nagreeable to HER.  Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take\\r\\nthe hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\r\\nconsequence of any reply.  Mr. Collins might never make the\\r\\noffer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk\\r\\nof, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable\\r\\nstate at this time, for form the day of the invitation, to the day of\\r\\nthe ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their\\r\\nwalking to Meryton once.  No aunt, no officers, no news could\\r\\nbe sought after-- the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by\\r\\nproxy.  Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her\\r\\npatience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of\\r\\nher acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a\\r\\ndance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday,\\r\\nSunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and\\r\\nlooked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats\\r\\nthere assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred\\r\\nto her.  The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by\\r\\nany of those recollections that might not unreasonably have\\r\\nalarmed her.  She had dressed with more than usual care, and\\r\\nprepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that\\r\\nremained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more\\r\\nthan might be won in the course of the evening.  But in an\\r\\ninstant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely\\r\\nomitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s pleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the\\r\\nofficers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute\\r\\nfact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to\\r\\nwhom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham\\r\\nhad been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and\\r\\nwas not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, \"I do not\\r\\nimagine his business would have called him away just now, if he\\r\\nhad not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\\r\\ncaught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\\r\\nless answerable for Wickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise\\r\\nhad been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former\\r\\nwas so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could\\r\\nhardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which\\r\\nhe directly afterwards approached to make.  Attendance,\\r\\nforbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.  She\\r\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and\\r\\nturned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not\\r\\nwholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind\\r\\npartiality provoked her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\\r\\nprospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not\\r\\ndwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was\\r\\nsoon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her\\r\\ncousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.  The first\\r\\ntwo dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\r\\ndances of mortification.  Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\r\\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong\\r\\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery\\r\\nwhich disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.  The\\r\\nmoment of her release from him was ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of\\r\\ntalking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\r\\nWhen those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas,\\r\\nand was in conversation with her, when she found herself\\r\\nsuddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by\\r\\nsurprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing\\r\\nwhat she did, she accepted him.  He walked away again\\r\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of\\r\\npresence of mind;  Charlotte tried to console her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heaven forbid!  THAT would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\r\\nTo find a man agreeable whom on is determined to hate!  Do not\\r\\nwish me such an evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy\\r\\napproached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help\\r\\ncautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her\\r\\nfancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of\\r\\na man ten times his consequence.  Elizabeth made no answer,\\r\\nand took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she\\r\\nwas arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nand reading in her neighbours\\' looks, their equal amazement in\\r\\nbeholding it.  They stood for some time without speaking a\\r\\nword; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last\\r\\nthrough the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it;\\r\\ntill suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to\\r\\nher partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight\\r\\nobservation on the dance.  He replied, and was again silent.\\r\\nAfter a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\r\\nwith:-- \"It is YOUR turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\ntalked about the dance, and YOU ought to make some sort of\\r\\nremark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\\r\\nshould be said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  That reply will do for the present.  Perhaps by and\\r\\nby I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than\\r\\npublic ones.  But NOW we may be silent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sometimes.  One must speak a little, you know.  It would look\\r\\nodd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the\\r\\nadvantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so arranged, as\\r\\nthat they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\\r\\nyou imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\r\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.  We are each of an unsocial,\\r\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\r\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down\\r\\nto posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I\\r\\nam sure,\" said he.  \"How near it may be to MINE, I cannot\\r\\npretend to say.  YOU think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\\r\\ndown the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not\\r\\nvery often walk to Meryton?  She answered in the affirmative,\\r\\nand, unable to resist the temptation, added, \"When you met us\\r\\nthere the other day, we had just been forming a new\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect was immediate.  A deeper shade of hauteur\\r\\noverspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth,\\r\\nthough blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.\\r\\nAt length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, \"Mr.\\r\\nWickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his\\r\\nMAKING friends-- whether he may be equally capable of\\r\\nRETAINING them, is less certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to\\r\\nsuffer from all his life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the\\r\\nsubject.  At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to\\r\\nthem, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the\\r\\nroom; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of\\r\\nsuperior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his\\r\\npartner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.  Such\\r\\nvery superior dancing is not often seen.  It is evident that you\\r\\nbelong to the first circles.  Allow me to say, however, that your\\r\\nfair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have\\r\\nthis pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable\\r\\nevent, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall\\r\\ntake place.  What congratulations will then flow in!  I appeal to\\r\\nMr. Darcy:-- but let me not interrupt you, sir.  You will not\\r\\nthank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\r\\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\\r\\nSir William\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly,\\r\\nand his eyes were directed with a very serious expression\\r\\ntowards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\r\\nRecovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,\\r\\nand said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what\\r\\nwe were talking of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all.  Sir William could not\\r\\nhave interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for\\r\\nthemselves.  We have tried two or three subjects already without\\r\\nsuccess, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Books-- oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with\\r\\nthe same feelings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at\\r\\nleast be no want of subject.  We may compare our different\\r\\nopinions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always\\r\\nfull of something else.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes-- does it?\"\\r\\nsaid he, with a look of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for\\r\\nher thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\\r\\nafterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember\\r\\nhearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,\\r\\nthat you resentment once created was unappeasable.  You are\\r\\nvery cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING CREATED.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their\\r\\nopinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character,\" said she,\\r\\nendeavouring to shake off her gravity.  \"I am trying to make it\\r\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.  \"I do not get on at all.  I hear such\\r\\ndifferent accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may\\r\\nvary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,\\r\\nthat you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,\\r\\nas there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no\\r\\ncredit on either.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have\\r\\nanother opportunity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly\\r\\nreplied.  She said no more, and they went down the other dance\\r\\nand parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to\\r\\nan equal degree, for in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerable\\r\\npowerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon,\\r\\nand directed all his anger against another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards\\r\\nher, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:-- \"So,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\\r\\nWickham!  Your sister has been talking to me about him, and\\r\\nasking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man\\r\\nquite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he\\r\\nwas the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\\'s steward.  Let\\r\\nme recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\\r\\nconfidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\\'s using him\\r\\nill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been\\r\\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\r\\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.  I do not know the\\r\\nparticulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\\r\\nleast to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\\r\\nmentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could\\r\\nnot well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\r\\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\\r\\nway.  His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\\r\\nindeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.  I pity you,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really,\\r\\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\r\\nsame,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him\\r\\nof nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward,\\r\\nand of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\\r\\nsneer.  \"Excuse my interference: it was kindly meant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself.  \"You are much\\r\\nmistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack\\r\\nas this.  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\\r\\nmalice of Mr. Darcy.\"  She then sought her eldest sister, who\\r\\nhas undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.\\r\\nJane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of\\r\\nsuch happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\r\\nsatisfied with the occurrences of the evening.  Elizabeth instantly\\r\\nread her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham,\\r\\nresentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\r\\nbefore the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling\\r\\nthan her sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.\\r\\nBut perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of\\r\\nany third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\nsatisfactory to tell you.  Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\r\\nhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\r\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good\\r\\nconduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly\\r\\nconvinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention\\r\\nfrom Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by\\r\\nhis account as well as his sister\\'s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a\\r\\nrespectable young man.  I am afraid he has been very imprudent,\\r\\nand has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.  I\\r\\nam satisfied.  But what does he say of the living?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\\r\\nheard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that\\r\\nit was left to him CONDITIONALLY only.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth\\r\\nwarmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by\\r\\nassurances only.  Mr. Bingley\\'s defense of his friend was a very\\r\\nable one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several\\r\\nparts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend\\r\\nhimself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did\\r\\nbefore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\\r\\nand on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\\r\\nElizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest\\r\\nhopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\\'s regard, and said\\r\\nall in her power to heighten her confidence in it.  On their being\\r\\njoined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss\\r\\nLucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner\\r\\nshe had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\r\\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so\\r\\nfortunate as to make a most important discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is\\r\\nnow in the room a near relation of my patroness.  I happened to\\r\\noverhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady\\r\\nwho does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss\\r\\nde Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How\\r\\nwonderfully these sort of things occur!  Who would have\\r\\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh in his assembly!  I am most thankful that\\r\\nthe discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him,\\r\\nwhich I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not\\r\\nhaving done it before.  My total ignorance of the connection\\r\\nmust plead my apology.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I am.  I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it\\r\\nearlier.  I believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s NEPHEW.  It will\\r\\nbe in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well\\r\\nyesterday se\\'nnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme,\\r\\nassuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him\\r\\nwithout introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a\\r\\ncompliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary\\r\\nthere should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it\\r\\nmust belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin\\r\\nthe acquaintance.  Mr. Collins listened to her with the\\r\\ndetermined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\r\\nceased speaking, replied thus:-- \"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have\\r\\nthe highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in\\r\\nall matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit\\r\\nme to say, that there must be a wide difference between the\\r\\nestablished forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those\\r\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I\\r\\nconsider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the\\r\\nhighest rank in the kingdom-- provided that a proper humility of\\r\\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore\\r\\nallow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this\\r\\noccasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point\\r\\nof duty.  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,\\r\\nwhich on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though\\r\\nin the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\\r\\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady\\r\\nlike yourself.\"  And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched,\\r\\nand whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.\\r\\nHer cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though\\r\\nshe could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and\\r\\nsaw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\"\\r\\nand \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"  It vexed her to see him\\r\\nexpose himself to such a man.  Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\r\\nunrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\r\\ntime to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.  Mr. Collins,\\r\\nhowever, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\\r\\nof his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\\r\\nslight bow, and moved another way.  Mr. Collins then returned\\r\\nto Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with\\r\\nmy reception.  Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\\r\\nattention.  He answered me with the utmost civility, and even\\r\\npaid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be certain she could never\\r\\nbestow a favour unworthily.  It was really a very handsome\\r\\nthought.  Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue,\\r\\nshe turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\r\\nBingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her\\r\\nobservations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\\r\\nJane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\\r\\nfelicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\\r\\nfelt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\\r\\nlike Bingley\\'s two sisters.  Her mother\\'s thoughts she plainly saw\\r\\nwere bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\\r\\nher, lest she might hear too much.  When they sat down to\\r\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness\\r\\nwhich placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she\\r\\nvexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person\\r\\n(Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her\\r\\nexpectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley.  It\\r\\nwas an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of\\r\\nfatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.  His\\r\\nbeing such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\r\\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\\r\\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters\\r\\nwere of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the\\r\\nconnection as much as she could do.  It was, moreover, such a\\r\\npromising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so\\r\\ngreatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly,\\r\\nit was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her\\r\\nsingle daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be\\r\\nobliged to go into company more than she liked.  It was\\r\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure,\\r\\nbecause on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less\\r\\nlikely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any\\r\\nperiod of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that\\r\\nLady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate,  though evidently\\r\\nand triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\\r\\nmother\\'s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less\\r\\naudible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could\\r\\nperceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who\\r\\nsat opposite to them.  Her mother only scolded her for being\\r\\nnonsensical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?\\r\\nI am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged\\r\\nto say nothing HE may not like to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it\\r\\nbe for you to offend Mr. Darcy?  You will never recommend\\r\\nyourself to his friend by so doing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence.  Her\\r\\nmother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\r\\nElizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.\\r\\nShe could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nthough every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for\\r\\nthough he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\r\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.  The\\r\\nexpression of his face changed gradually from indignant\\r\\ncontempt to a composed and steady gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\\r\\nLucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights\\r\\nwhich she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts\\r\\nof cold ham and chicken.  Elizabeth now began to revive.  But\\r\\nnot long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was\\r\\nover, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of\\r\\nseeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\\r\\ncompany.  By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did\\r\\nshe endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in\\r\\nvain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\r\\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations,\\r\\nand she watched her progress through the several stanzas with\\r\\nan impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for\\r\\nMary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a\\r\\nhope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after\\r\\nthe pause of half a minute began another.  Mary\\'s powers were\\r\\nby no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and\\r\\nher manner affected.  Elizabeth was in agonies.  She looked at\\r\\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\r\\ntalking to Bingley.  She looked at his two sisters, and saw them\\r\\nmaking signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who\\r\\ncontinued, however, imperturbably grave.  She looked at her\\r\\nfather to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all\\r\\nnight.  He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second\\r\\nsong, said aloud, \"That will do extremely well, child.  You have\\r\\ndelighted us long enough.  Let the other young ladies have time\\r\\nto exhibit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat\\r\\ndisconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her\\r\\nfather\\'s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.\\r\\nOthers of the party were now applied to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing,\\r\\nI should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company\\r\\nwith an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion,\\r\\nand perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.  I\\r\\ndo not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in\\r\\ndevoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly\\r\\nother things to be attended to.  The rector of a parish has much\\r\\nto do.  In the first place, he must make such an agreement for\\r\\ntithes as a may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his\\r\\npatron.  He must write his own sermons; and the time that\\r\\nremains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\r\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused\\r\\nfrom making as a comfortable as a possible.  And I do not think\\r\\nit of light importance that he should have attentive and\\r\\nconciliatory manner towards everybody, especially towards\\r\\nthose to whom he owes his preferment.  I cannot acquit him of\\r\\nthat duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\r\\noccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected\\r\\nwith the family.\"  And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\\r\\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as a to be heard by\\r\\nhalf the room.  Many stared-- many smiled; but no one looked\\r\\nmore amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously\\r\\ncommended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and\\r\\nobserved in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a\\r\\nremarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\\r\\nto expose themselves as a much as a they could during the\\r\\nevening, it would have been impossible for them to play their\\r\\nparts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it\\r\\nfor Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had\\r\\nescaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be\\r\\nmuch distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.\\r\\nThat his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such\\r\\nan opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and\\r\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\r\\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more\\r\\nintolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement.  She was\\r\\nteased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her\\r\\nside, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him\\r\\nagain, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In vain did\\r\\nshe entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to\\r\\nintroduce him to any young lady in the room.  He assured her,\\r\\nthat as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his\\r\\nchief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\r\\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close\\r\\nto her the whole evening.  There was no arguing upon such a\\r\\nproject.  She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas,\\r\\nwho often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s conversation to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\\'s further\\r\\nnotice; though often standing within a very short distance of her,\\r\\nquite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.  She felt\\r\\nit to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\r\\nWickham, and rejoiced in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\\r\\nand, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their\\r\\ncarriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,\\r\\nwhich gave them time to see how heartily they were wished\\r\\naway by some of the family.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely\\r\\nopened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were\\r\\nevidently impatient to have the house to themselves.  They\\r\\nrepulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by\\r\\nso doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very\\r\\nlittle relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was\\r\\ncomplimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of\\r\\ntheir entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had\\r\\nmarked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing at all.\\r\\nMr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.  Mr.\\r\\nBingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from\\r\\nthe rest, and talked only to each other.  Elizabeth preserved as\\r\\nsteady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even\\r\\nLydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional\\r\\nexclamation of \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a\\r\\nviolent yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\\r\\npressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at\\r\\nLongbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to\\r\\nassure him how happy he would make them by eating a family\\r\\ndinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal\\r\\ninvitation.  Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily\\r\\nengaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,\\r\\nafter his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the\\r\\nnext day for a short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under\\r\\nthe delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary\\r\\npreparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,\\r\\nshe should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in\\r\\nthe course of three or four months.  Of having another daughter\\r\\nmarried to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and\\r\\nwith considerable, though not equal, pleasure.  Elizabeth was the\\r\\nleast dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the\\r\\nmatch were quite good enough for HER, the worth of each was\\r\\neclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmade his declaration in form.  Having resolved to do it without\\r\\nloss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the\\r\\nfollowing Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make\\r\\nit distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a\\r\\nvery orderly manner, with all the observances, which he\\r\\nsupposed a regular part of the business.  On finding Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\r\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \"May I\\r\\nhope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter\\r\\nElizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience\\r\\nwith her in the course of this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!-- yes-- certainly.  I\\r\\nam sure Lizzy will be very happy-- I am sure she can have no\\r\\nobjection, Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.\"  And, gathering\\r\\nher work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\r\\ncalled out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam, do not go.  I beg you will not go.  Mr. Collins\\r\\nmust excuse me.  He can have nothing to say to me that anybody\\r\\nneed not hear.  I am going away myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.  I desire you to stay where you are.\"\\r\\nAnd upon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and\\r\\nembarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I\\r\\nINSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth would not oppose such and injunction-- and a\\r\\nmoment\\'s consideration making her also sensible that it would\\r\\nbe wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat\\r\\ndown again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the\\r\\nfeelings which were divided between distress and diversion.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were\\r\\ngone, Mr. Collins began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far\\r\\nfrom doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\\r\\nperfections.  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had\\r\\nthere NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure\\r\\nyou, that I have your respected mother\\'s permission for this\\r\\naddress.  You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,\\r\\nhowever your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\r\\nattentions have been too marked to be mistaken.  Almost as\\r\\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion\\r\\nof my future life.  But before I am run away with by my feelings\\r\\non this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state\\r\\nmy reasons for marrying-- and, moreover, for coming into\\r\\nHertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being\\r\\nrun away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing,\\r\\nthat she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt\\r\\nto stop him further, and he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing\\r\\nfor every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set\\r\\nthe example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am\\r\\nconvinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and\\r\\nthirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it\\r\\nis the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble\\r\\nlady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has\\r\\nshe condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\r\\nsubject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\r\\nHunsford-- between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson\\r\\nwas arranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said,  \\'Mr.\\r\\nCollins, you must marry.  A clergyman like you must marry.\\r\\nChoose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY sake; and for\\r\\nyour OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought\\r\\nup high, but able to make a small income go a good way.  This is\\r\\nmy advice.  Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to\\r\\nHunsford, and I will visit her.\\'  Allow me, by the way, to\\r\\nobserve, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\r\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\r\\nadvantages in my power to offer.  You will find her manners\\r\\nbeyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I\\r\\nthink, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with\\r\\nthe silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.\\r\\nThus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it\\r\\nremains to be told why my views were directed towards\\r\\nLongbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can\\r\\nassure you there are many amiable young women.  But the fact\\r\\nis, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of\\r\\nyour honoured father (who, however, may live many years\\r\\nlonger), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a\\r\\nwife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as\\r\\nlittle as possible, when the melancholy event takes place-- which,\\r\\nhowever, as I have already said, may not be for several years.\\r\\nThis has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it\\r\\nwill not sink me in your esteem.  And now nothing remains but\\r\\nfor me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\r\\nviolence of my affection.  To fortune I am perfectly indifferent,\\r\\nand shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I\\r\\nam well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one\\r\\nthousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours\\r\\ntill after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be\\r\\nentitled to.  On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent;\\r\\nand you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall\\r\\never pass my lips when we are married.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried.  \"You forget that I have\\r\\nmade no answer.  Let me do it without further loss of time.\\r\\nAccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.  I am\\r\\nvery sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\\r\\nof the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the\\r\\naddresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when\\r\\nhe first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is\\r\\nrepeated a second, or even a third time.  I am therefore by no\\r\\nmeans discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to\\r\\nlead you to the altar ere long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\r\\nextraordinary one after my declaration.  I do assure you that I\\r\\nam not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)\\r\\nwho are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of\\r\\nbeing asked a second time.  I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\r\\nYou could not make ME happy, and I am convinced that I am\\r\\nthe last woman in the world who could make you so.  Nay, were\\r\\nyour friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she\\r\\nwould find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr.\\r\\nCollins very gravely-- \"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship\\r\\nwould at all disapprove of you.  And you may be certain when I\\r\\nhave the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very\\r\\nhighest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable\\r\\nqualification.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.  You\\r\\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the\\r\\ncompliment of believing what I say.  I wish you very happy and\\r\\nvery rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to\\r\\nprevent your being otherwise.  In making me the offer, you must\\r\\nhave satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my\\r\\nfamily, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever\\r\\nit falls, without any self-reproach.  This matter may be\\r\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.\"  And rising as she thus\\r\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not\\r\\nthus addressed her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the\\r\\nsubject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than\\r\\nyou have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of\\r\\ncruelty at present, because I know it to be the established\\r\\ncustom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and\\r\\nperhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit\\r\\nas would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\r\\ncharacter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you\\r\\npuzzle me exceedingly.  If what I have hitherto said can appear\\r\\nto you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express\\r\\nmy refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that\\r\\nyour refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.  My\\r\\nreasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to\\r\\nme that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the\\r\\nestablishment I can offer would be any other than highly\\r\\ndesirable.  My situation in life, my connections with the family of\\r\\nde Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances\\r\\nhighly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by\\r\\nno means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be\\r\\nmade you.  Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all\\r\\nlikelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable\\r\\nqualifications.  As I must therefore conclude that you are not\\r\\nserious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to\\r\\nyour wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the\\r\\nusual practice of elegant females.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that\\r\\nkind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.\\r\\nI would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.\\r\\nI thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in\\r\\nyour proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.  My\\r\\nfeelings in every respect forbid it.  Can I speak plainer?  Do not\\r\\nconsider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you,\\r\\nbut as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\\r\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the\\r\\nexpress authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals\\r\\nwill not fail of being acceptable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\\r\\nmake no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew,\\r\\ndetermined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated\\r\\nrefusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father,\\r\\nwhose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be\\r\\ndecisive, and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for\\r\\nthe affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\\r\\nvestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\\r\\nElizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards\\r\\nthe staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and\\r\\ncongratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy\\r\\nprospect or their nearer connection.  Mr. Collins received and\\r\\nreturned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\r\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the\\r\\nresult of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied,\\r\\nsince the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him\\r\\nwould naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine\\r\\ndelicacy of her character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would\\r\\nhave been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had\\r\\nmeant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but\\r\\nshe dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall\\r\\nbe brought to reason.  I will speak to her about it directly.  She\\r\\nis a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own\\r\\ninterest but I will MAKE her know it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins;\\r\\n\"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether\\r\\nshe would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\\r\\nsituation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\\r\\nstate.  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\\r\\nperhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\\r\\nbecause if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\\r\\ncontribute much to my felicity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\\r\\n\"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.  In everything\\r\\nelse she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.  I will go directly\\r\\nto Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am\\r\\nsure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\\r\\nher husband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh! Mr.\\r\\nBennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\r\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows\\r\\nshe will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will\\r\\nchange his mind and not have HER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\\r\\nfixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in\\r\\nthe least altered by her communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when\\r\\nshe had finished her speech.  \"Of what are you talking?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.  Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have\\r\\nLizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?  It seems an hopeless\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.  Tell her that you insist upon\\r\\nher marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let her be called down.  She shall hear my opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to\\r\\nthe library.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared.  \"I have\\r\\nsent for you on an affair of importance.  I understand that Mr.\\r\\nCollins has made you an offer of marriage.  Is it true?\"  Elizabeth\\r\\nreplied that it was.  \"Very well-- and this offer of marriage you\\r\\nhave refused?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well.  We now come to the point.  Your mother insists\\r\\nupon your accepting it.  Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.  From this day\\r\\nyou must be a stranger to one of your parents.  Your mother will\\r\\nnever see you again if you do NOT marry Mr. Collins, and I will\\r\\nnever see you again if you DO.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\\r\\nbeginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\\r\\nhusband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\\r\\ndisappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?  You\\r\\npromised me to INSIST upon her marrying him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to\\r\\nrequest.  First, that you will allow me the free use of my\\r\\nunderstanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my\\r\\nroom.  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as\\r\\nmay be.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\\r\\ndid Mrs. Bennet give up the point.  She talked to Elizabeth again\\r\\nand again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.  She endeavoured\\r\\nto secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\\r\\nmildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\\r\\nreal earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\\r\\nher attacks.  Though her manner varied, however, her\\r\\ndetermination never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\\r\\npassed.  He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\\r\\nmotives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\\r\\nhurt, he suffered in no other way.  His regard for her was quite\\r\\nimaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\'s\\r\\nreproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\\r\\nspend the day with them.  She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\\r\\nwho, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are\\r\\ncome, for there is such fun here!  What do you think has\\r\\nhappened this morning?  Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy,\\r\\nand she will not have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\\r\\nKitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\\r\\nentered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than\\r\\nshe likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\\r\\ncompassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\\r\\ncomply with the wishes of all her family.  \"Pray do, my dear\\r\\nMiss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on\\r\\nmy side, nobody takes part with me.  I am cruelly used, nobody\\r\\nfeels for my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as\\r\\nunconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we\\r\\nwere at York, provided she can have her own way.  But I tell\\r\\nyou, Miss Lizzy-- if you take it into your head to go on refusing\\r\\nevery offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband\\r\\nat all-- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  I shall not be able to keep you--\\r\\nand so I warn you.  I have done with you from this very day.  I\\r\\ntold you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to\\r\\nyou again, and you will find me as good as my word.  I have no\\r\\npleasure in talking to undutiful children.  Not that I have much\\r\\npleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.  People who suffer as I\\r\\ndo from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for\\r\\ntalking.  Nobody can tell what I suffer!  But it is always so.\\r\\nThose who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\r\\nany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only\\r\\nincrease the irritation.  She talked on, therefore, without\\r\\ninterruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.\\r\\nCollins, who entered the room with an air more stately than\\r\\nusual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \"Now, I do\\r\\ninsist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me\\r\\nand Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\\r\\nfollowed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\\r\\ncould; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nwhose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute,\\r\\nand then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the\\r\\nwindow and pretending not to hear.  In a doleful voice Mrs.\\r\\nBennet began the projected conversation: \"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam, \" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this\\r\\npoint.  Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that\\r\\nmarked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter.\\r\\nResignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the\\r\\npeculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\\r\\nhave been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.\\r\\nPerhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive\\r\\nhappiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\\r\\nhave often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when\\r\\nthe blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\r\\nestimation.  You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\\r\\ndisrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing\\r\\nmy pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without having paid\\r\\nyourself and Mr. Bennet to compliment of requesting you to\\r\\ninterpose your authority in my behalf.  My conduct may, I fear,\\r\\nbe objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\\r\\ndaughter\\'s lips instead of your own.  But we are all liable to\\r\\nerror.  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.  My\\r\\nobject has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\\r\\ndue consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my\\r\\nMANNER has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\\r\\napologise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end,\\r\\nand Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings\\r\\nnecessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish\\r\\nallusions of her mother.  As for the gentleman himself, HIS\\r\\nfeelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or\\r\\ndejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner\\r\\nand resentful silence.  He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\\r\\nassiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\\r\\nwere transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\r\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\r\\nespecially to her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\\'s ill-humour\\r\\nor ill health.  Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry\\r\\npride.  Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his\\r\\nvisit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.  He\\r\\nwas always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant\\r\\nto stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.\\r\\nWickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from\\r\\nthe Netherfield ball.  He joined them on their entering the town,\\r\\nand attended them to their aunt\\'s where his regret and vexation,\\r\\nand the concern of everybody, was well talked over.  To\\r\\nElizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the\\r\\nnecessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not\\r\\nmeet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party\\r\\nwith him for so many hours together, might be more than I could\\r\\nbear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than\\r\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\\r\\nfull discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they\\r\\ncivilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer\\r\\nwalked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he\\r\\nparticularly attended to her.  His accompanying them was a\\r\\ndouble advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to\\r\\nherself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing\\r\\nhim to her father and mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it\\r\\ncame from Netherfield.  The envelope contained a sheet of\\r\\nelegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair,\\r\\nflowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change\\r\\nas she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular\\r\\npassages.  Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter\\r\\naway, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general\\r\\nconversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which\\r\\ndrew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had\\r\\nhe and he companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\r\\ninvited her to follow her upstairs.  When they had gained their\\r\\nown room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, \"This is from\\r\\nCaroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\r\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\r\\ntheir way to town-- and without any intention of coming back\\r\\nagain.  You shall hear what she says.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the\\r\\ninformation of their having just resolved to follow their brother\\r\\nto town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet, where Mr. Hurst had a house.  The next was in these\\r\\nwords: \"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in\\r\\nHertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we\\r\\nwill hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\r\\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\r\\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\r\\nunreserved correspondence.  I depend on you for that.\"  To\\r\\nthese highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the\\r\\ninsensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their\\r\\nremoval surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it\\r\\nwas not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield\\r\\nwould prevent Mr. Bingley\\'s being there; and as to the loss of\\r\\ntheir society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard\\r\\nit, in the enjoyment of his.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should\\r\\nnot be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\r\\nBut may we not hope that the period of future happiness to\\r\\nwhich Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is\\r\\naware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as\\r\\nfriends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?\\r\\nMr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\r\\nHertfordshire this winter.  I will read it to you:\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the\\r\\nbusiness which took him to London might be concluded in three\\r\\nor four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the\\r\\nsame time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be\\r\\nin no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following\\r\\nhim thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours\\r\\nin a comfortless hotel.  Many of my acquaintances are already\\r\\nthere for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest\\r\\nfriend, had any intention of making one of the crowd-- but of\\r\\nthat I despair.  I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire\\r\\nmay abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings,\\r\\nand that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your\\r\\nfeeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more\\r\\nthis winter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\\r\\nSHOULD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why will you think so?  It must be his own doing.  He is his\\r\\nown master.  But you do not know ALL.  I WILL read you the\\r\\npassage which particularly hurts me.  I will have no reserves\\r\\nfrom YOU.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\'Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the\\r\\ntruth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again.  I really do\\r\\nnot think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,\\r\\nand accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa\\r\\nand myself is heightened into something still more interesting,\\r\\nfrom the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our\\r\\nsister.  I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you\\r\\nmy feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country\\r\\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\r\\nunreasonable.  My brother admires her greatly already; he will\\r\\nhave frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most\\r\\nintimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as\\r\\nhis own; and a sister\\'s partiality is not misleading me, I think,\\r\\nwhen I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\'s\\r\\nheart.  With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and\\r\\nnothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging\\r\\nthe hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\\' \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said\\r\\nJane as she finished it.  \"Is it not clear enough?  Does it not\\r\\nexpressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to\\r\\nbe her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s\\r\\nindifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for\\r\\nhim, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?  Can\\r\\nthere be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.  Will you hear it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou shall have it in a few words.  Miss Bingley sees that her\\r\\nbrother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\r\\nShe follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries\\r\\nto persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.  No one who has ever\\r\\nseen you together can doubt his affection.  Miss Bingley, I am\\r\\nsure, cannot.  She is not such a simpleton.  Could she have seen\\r\\nhalf as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have\\r\\nordered her wedding clothes.  But the case is this: We are not\\r\\nrich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more\\r\\nanxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\\r\\nwhen there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less\\r\\ntrouble in achieving a second: in which there is certainly some\\r\\ningenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nwere out of the way.  But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously\\r\\nimagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly\\r\\nadmires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of\\r\\nYOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or\\r\\nthat it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being\\r\\nin love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\r\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy.  But I know\\r\\nthe foundation is unjust.  Caroline is incapable of wilfully\\r\\ndeceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she\\r\\nis deceiving herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is right.  You could not have started a more happy idea,\\r\\nsince you will not take comfort in mine.  Believe her to be\\r\\ndeceived, by all means.  You have now done your duty by her,\\r\\nand must fret no longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\r\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to\\r\\nmarry elsewhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon\\r\\nmature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his\\r\\ntwo sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his\\r\\nwife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling.  \"You must\\r\\nknow that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their\\r\\ndisapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot\\r\\nconsider your situation with much compassion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\r\\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the\\r\\nutmost contempt.  It appeared to her merely the suggestion of\\r\\nCaroline\\'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment\\r\\nsuppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,\\r\\ncould influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\r\\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy\\r\\neffect.  Jane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was\\r\\ngradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\\r\\nsometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\\r\\nNetherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure\\r\\nof the family, without being alarmed on the score of the\\r\\ngentleman\\'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave\\r\\nher a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly\\r\\nunlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they\\r\\nwere all getting so intimate together.  After lamenting it,\\r\\nhowever, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\r\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at\\r\\nLongbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable\\r\\ndeclaration, that though he had been invited only to a family\\r\\ndinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again\\r\\nduring the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to\\r\\nMr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.  \"It\\r\\nkeeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to\\r\\nyou than I can express.\"  Charlotte assured her friend of her\\r\\nsatisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the\\r\\nlittle sacrifice of her time.  This was very amiable, but\\r\\nCharlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any\\r\\nconception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\r\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins\\'s addresses, by engaging them\\r\\ntowards herself.  Such was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and\\r\\nappearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night,\\r\\nshe would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been\\r\\nto leave Hertfordshire so very soon.  But here she did injustice\\r\\nto the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to\\r\\nescape out of Longbourn House the next morning with\\r\\nadmirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself\\r\\nat her feet.  He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\r\\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail\\r\\nto conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the\\r\\nattempt known till its success might be known likewise; for\\r\\nthough feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had\\r\\nbeen tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since\\r\\nthe adventure of Wednesday.  His reception, however, was of\\r\\nthe most flattering kind.  Miss Lucas perceived him from an\\r\\nupper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set\\r\\nout to meet him accidentally in the lane.  But little had she dared\\r\\nto hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\\'s long speeches would allow,\\r\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;\\r\\nand as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name\\r\\nthe day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though\\r\\nsuch a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt\\r\\nno inclination to trifle with his happiness.  The stupidity with\\r\\nwhich he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from\\r\\nany charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance;\\r\\nand Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\\r\\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\r\\nestablishment were gained.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their\\r\\nconsent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.  Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for\\r\\ntheir daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his\\r\\nprospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.  Lady Lucas\\r\\nbegan directly to calculate, with more interest than the\\r\\nmatter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.\\r\\nBennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\r\\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\r\\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\\r\\nhis wife should make their appearance at St. James\\'s. The whole\\r\\nfamily, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.  The\\r\\nyounger girls formed hopes of COMING OUT a year or two\\r\\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were\\r\\nrelieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s dying an old\\r\\nmaid.  Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.  She had\\r\\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it.  Her reflections\\r\\nwere in general satisfactory.  Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither\\r\\nsensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\\r\\nattachment to her must be imaginary.  But still he would be her\\r\\nhusband.  Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\\r\\nmarriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\\r\\nfor well-educated young women of small fortune, and however\\r\\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\r\\npreservative from want.  This preservative she had now\\r\\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever\\r\\nbeen handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.  The least\\r\\nagreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must\\r\\noccasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued\\r\\nbeyond that of any other person.  Elizabeth would wonder, and\\r\\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to\\r\\nbe shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.\\r\\nShe resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore\\r\\ncharged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\\r\\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.  A\\r\\npromise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it\\r\\ncould not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by\\r\\nhis long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his\\r\\nreturn as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the\\r\\nsame time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\r\\npublish his prosperous love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see\\r\\nany of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed\\r\\nwhen the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with\\r\\ngreat politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to\\r\\nsee him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might\\r\\nallow him to visit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\r\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\r\\nyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\r\\npossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no\\r\\nmeans wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation\\r\\nhere, my good sir?  You had better neglect your relations than\\r\\nrun the risk of offending your patroness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins,\" I am particularly obliged to\\r\\nyou for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not\\r\\ntaking so material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard.  Risk anything\\r\\nrather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by\\r\\nyour coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly\\r\\nprobable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that WE shall\\r\\ntake no offence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited, by\\r\\nsuch affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily\\r\\nreceive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other\\r\\nmark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.  As for my\\r\\nfair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to\\r\\nrender it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them\\r\\nhealth and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them\\r\\nequally surprised that he meditated a quick return.  Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwished to understand by it that he thought of paying his\\r\\naddresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been\\r\\nprevailed on to accept him.  She rated his abilities much higher\\r\\nthan any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections\\r\\nwhich often struck her, and though by no means so clever as\\r\\nherself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve\\r\\nhimself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\r\\nagreeable companion.  But on the following morning, every\\r\\nhope of this kind was done away.  Miss Lucas called soon after\\r\\nbreakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the\\r\\nevent of the day before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying herself in love with her\\r\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two;\\r\\nbut that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far\\r\\nfrom possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her\\r\\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first\\r\\nthe bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins!  My dear Charlotte-- impossible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in\\r\\ntelling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on\\r\\nreceiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than\\r\\nshe expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?  Do you think it\\r\\nincredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any\\r\\nwoman\\'s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to\\r\\nsucceed with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong\\r\\neffort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the\\r\\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that\\r\\nshe wished her all imaginable happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte.  \"You must be\\r\\nsurprised, very much surprised-- so lately as Mr. Collins was\\r\\nwishing to marry you.  But when you have had time to think it\\r\\nover, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.  I am\\r\\nnot romantic, you know; I never was.  I ask only a comfortable\\r\\nhome; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s character, connection, and\\r\\nsituation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness\\r\\nwith him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the\\r\\nmarriage state.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly\"; and after an\\r\\nawkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\\r\\nCharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left\\r\\nto reflect on what she had heard.  It was a long time before she\\r\\nbecame at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.\\r\\nThe strangeness of Mr. Collins\\'s making two offers of marriage\\r\\nwithin three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\r\\naccepted.  She had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of\\r\\nmatrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not\\r\\nsupposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she\\r\\nwould have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.\\r\\nCharlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture!\\r\\nAnd to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her\\r\\nesteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was\\r\\nimpossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\r\\nchosen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\\r\\nwhat she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\\r\\nmention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\\r\\ndaughter, to announce her engagement to the family.  With many\\r\\ncompliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect\\r\\nof a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter-- to\\r\\nan audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he\\r\\nmust be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\r\\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?  Do not\\r\\nyou know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have\\r\\nborne without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good\\r\\nbreeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave\\r\\nto be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all\\r\\ntheir impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\\r\\nunpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\\r\\naccount, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\\r\\nherself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\\r\\nmother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\\r\\nSir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\\r\\nmaking a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\\r\\nexpected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\\r\\nand the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great\\r\\ndeal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them\\r\\nthan her feelings found a rapid vent.  In the first place, she\\r\\npersisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\\r\\nwas very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\\r\\ntrusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\\r\\nthat the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however,\\r\\nwere plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was\\r\\nthe real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had\\r\\nbeen barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points\\r\\nshe principally dwelt during the rest of the day.  Nothing could\\r\\nconsole and nothing could appease her.  Nor did that day wear\\r\\nout her resentment.  A week elapsed before she could see\\r\\nElizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she\\r\\ncould speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude,\\r\\nand many months were gone before she could at all forgive her\\r\\ndaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the\\r\\noccasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of\\r\\na most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover\\r\\nthat Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\\r\\nsensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\\r\\ndaughter!\\r\\n\\r\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\r\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their\\r\\nhappiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as\\r\\nimprobable.  Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\\r\\nfor Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\\r\\nother way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\\r\\nretort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\\r\\nmarried; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual\\r\\nto say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\\'s sour looks and\\r\\nill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which\\r\\nkept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt\\r\\npersuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between\\r\\nthem again.  Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with\\r\\nfonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she\\r\\nwas sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose\\r\\nhappiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been\\r\\ngone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\\r\\ncounting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\r\\nThe promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\\r\\nTuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\\r\\nsolemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\'s abode in the\\r\\nfamily might have prompted.  After discharging his conscience\\r\\non that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\\r\\nexpressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\\r\\ntheir amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\\r\\nwas merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\\r\\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again\\r\\nat Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\\r\\nfortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved\\r\\nhis marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\\r\\nwhich he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\\r\\namiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\r\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet.  On the contrary, she was as much\\r\\ndisposed to complain of it as her husband.  It was very strange\\r\\nthat he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\\r\\nwas also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.  She\\r\\nhated having visitors in the house while her health was so\\r\\nindifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.\\r\\nSuch were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave\\r\\nway only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\\'s continued\\r\\nabsence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.\\r\\nDay after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of\\r\\nhim than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his\\r\\ncoming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which\\r\\nhighly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to\\r\\ncontradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear-- not that Bingley was indifferent--\\r\\nbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\r\\nUnwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s\\r\\nhappiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\\r\\ncould not prevent its frequently occurring.  The united efforts of\\r\\nhis two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted\\r\\nby the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London\\r\\nmight be too much, she feared, for the strength of his\\r\\nattachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\\r\\nmore painful than Elizabeth\\'s, but whatever she felt she was\\r\\ndesirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\\r\\ntherefore, the subject was never alluded to.  But as no such\\r\\ndelicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\\r\\nshe did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival,\\r\\nor even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she\\r\\nwould think herself very ill used.  It needed all Jane\\'s steady\\r\\nmildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but\\r\\nhis reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had\\r\\nbeen on his first introduction.  He was too happy, however, to\\r\\nneed much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of\\r\\nlove-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.\\r\\nThe chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\\r\\nsometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an\\r\\napology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.  The very\\r\\nmention of anything concerning the match threw her into an\\r\\nagony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of\\r\\nhearing it talked of.  The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.\\r\\nAs her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous\\r\\nabhorrence.  Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she\\r\\nconcluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\r\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was\\r\\nconvinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and\\r\\nresolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as\\r\\nsoon as Mr. Bennet were dead.  She complained bitterly of all\\r\\nthis to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that\\r\\nCharlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I\\r\\nshould be forced to make way for HER, and live to see her take\\r\\nher place in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.  Let us\\r\\nhope for better things.  Let us flatter ourselves that I may be\\r\\nthe survivor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead\\r\\nof making any answer, she went on as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.  If it\\r\\nwas not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\r\\ninsensibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\\r\\nentail.  How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\\r\\nestate from one\\'s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all\\r\\nfor the sake of Mr. Collins too!  Why should HE have it more\\r\\nthan anybody else?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.  The very\\r\\nfirst sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in\\r\\nLondon for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret\\r\\nat not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\\r\\nHertfordshire before he left the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\\r\\nrest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection\\r\\nof the writer, that could give her any comfort.  Miss Darcy\\'s\\r\\npraise occupied the chief of it.  Her many attractions were again\\r\\ndwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing\\r\\nintimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the\\r\\nwishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.  She wrote\\r\\nalso with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an inmate of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the\\r\\nlatter with regard to new furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of\\r\\nall this, heard it in silent indignation.  Her heart was divided\\r\\nbetween concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.\\r\\nTo Caroline\\'s assertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss\\r\\nDarcy she paid no credit.  That he was really fond of Jane, she\\r\\ndoubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\\r\\nalways been disposed to like him, she could not think without\\r\\nanger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\\r\\nwant of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\\r\\ndesigning friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\r\\nto the caprice of their inclination.  Had his own happiness,\\r\\nhowever, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\\r\\nsport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister\\'s\\r\\nwas involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.  It\\r\\nwas a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long\\r\\nindulged, and must be unavailing.  She could think of nothing\\r\\nelse; and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really died away, or\\r\\nwere suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether he had\\r\\nbeen aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\r\\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\\r\\nmust be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s\\r\\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\\r\\nfeelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them\\r\\ntogether, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\\r\\nand its master, she could not help saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!  She\\r\\ncan have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\\r\\nreflections on him.  But I will not repine.  It cannot last long.  He\\r\\nwill be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\\r\\nsaid nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you\\r\\nhave no reason.  He may live in my memory as the most amiable\\r\\nman of my acquaintance, but that is all.  I have nothing either to\\r\\nhope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.  Thank God! I\\r\\nhave not THAT pain. A little time, therefore-- I shall certainly\\r\\ntry to get the better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort\\r\\nimmediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\\r\\nmy side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.  Your\\r\\nsweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\\r\\nwhat to say to you.  I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\\r\\nloved you as you deserve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and\\r\\nthrew back the praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair.  YOU wish to think all\\r\\nthe world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I\\r\\nonly want to think YOU perfect, and you set yourself against it.\\r\\nDo not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my\\r\\nencroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.  You need\\r\\nnot.  There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of\\r\\nwhom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I\\r\\ndissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the\\r\\ninconsistency of all human characters, and of the little\\r\\ndependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\r\\nsense.  I have met with two instances lately, one I will not\\r\\nmention; the other is Charlotte\\'s marriage.  It is unaccountable!\\r\\nIn every view it is unaccountable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.  They\\r\\nwill ruin your happiness.  You do not make allowance enough\\r\\nfor difference of situation and temper.  Consider Mr. Collins\\'s\\r\\nrespectability, and Charlotte\\'s steady, prudent character.\\r\\nRemember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it\\r\\nis a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\\'s\\r\\nsake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our\\r\\ncousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\\r\\none else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\\r\\npersuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\\r\\nthink worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.\\r\\nMy dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-\\r\\nminded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must\\r\\nfeel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot\\r\\nhave a proper way of thinking.  You shall not defend her, though\\r\\nit is Charlotte Lucas.  You shall not, for the sake of one\\r\\nindividual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor\\r\\nendeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is\\r\\nprudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I musty think your language too strong in speaking of both,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\\r\\nthem happy together.  But enough of this.  You alluded to\\r\\nsomething else.  You mentioned TWO instances.  I cannot\\r\\nmisunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me\\r\\nby thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your opinion\\r\\nof him is sunk.  We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves\\r\\nintentionally injured.  We must not expect a lively young man to\\r\\nbe always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing\\r\\nbut our own vanity that deceives us.  Women fancy admiration\\r\\nmeans more than it does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no\\r\\nidea of there being so much design in the world as some persons\\r\\nimagine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to\\r\\ndesign,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or\\r\\nto make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be\\r\\nmisery.  Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\'s\\r\\nfeelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; to the last.  But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying\\r\\nwhat I think of persons you esteem Stop me whilst you can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot believe it.  Why should they try to influence him?\\r\\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no\\r\\nother woman can secure it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your first position is false.  They may wish many things besides\\r\\nhis happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\\r\\nconsequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\\r\\nimportance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\"\\r\\nreplied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are\\r\\nsupposing.  They have known her much longer than they have\\r\\nknown me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever\\r\\nmay be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have\\r\\nopposed their brother\\'s.  What sister would think herself at\\r\\nliberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?\\r\\nIf they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part\\r\\nus; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an\\r\\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong,\\r\\nand me most unhappy.  Do not distress me by the idea.  I am not\\r\\nashamed of having been mistaken-- or, at least, it is light, it is\\r\\nnothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him\\r\\nor his sisters.  Let me take it in the best light, in the light in\\r\\nwhich it may be understood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\r\\nBingley\\'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\\r\\nno more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\\r\\nnot account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\\r\\nconsidering it with less perplexity.  Her daughter endeavoured to\\r\\nconvince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\\r\\nattentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\\r\\ntransient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\\r\\nthough the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\\r\\nshe had the same story to repeat every day.  Mrs. Bennet\\'s best\\r\\ncomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the\\r\\nsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently.  \"So, Lizzy,\" said he\\r\\none day, \"your sister is crossed in love, I find.  I congratulate\\r\\nher.  Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in\\r\\nlove now and then.  It is something to think of, and it gives her a\\r\\nsort of distinction among her companions.  When is your turn to\\r\\ncome?  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.  Now is\\r\\nyour time.  Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\\r\\nthe young ladies in the country.  Let Wickham be your man.  He\\r\\nis a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.  We\\r\\nmust not all expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that\\r\\nwhatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\\r\\nmother who will make the most of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the\\r\\ngloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many\\r\\nof the Longbourn family.  They saw him often, and to his other\\r\\nrecommendations was now added that of general unreserve.\\r\\nThe whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on\\r\\nMr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now\\r\\nopenly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody\\r\\nwas pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr.\\r\\nDarcy before they had known anything of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there\\r\\nmight be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to\\r\\nthe society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\\r\\npleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--\\r\\nbut by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 25\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\\r\\nMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival\\r\\nof Saturday.  The pain of separation, however, might be\\r\\nalleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his\\r\\nbride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into\\r\\nHertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the\\r\\nhappiest of men.  He took leave of his relations at Longbourn\\r\\nwith as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health\\r\\nand happiness again, and promised their father another letter of\\r\\nthanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\\r\\nreceiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend\\r\\nthe Christmas at Longbourn.  Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by\\r\\nnature as education.  The Netherfield ladies would have had\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within\\r\\nview of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and\\r\\nagreeable.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent,\\r\\nelegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn\\r\\nnieces.  Between the two eldest and herself especially, there\\r\\nsubsisted a particular regard.  They had frequently been staying\\r\\nwith her in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s business on her arrival was to\\r\\ndistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.  When\\r\\nthis was done she had a less active part to play.  It became her\\r\\nturn to listen.  Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and\\r\\nmuch to complain of.  They had all been very ill-used since she\\r\\nlast saw her sister.  Two of her girls had been upon the point of\\r\\nmarriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have got\\r\\nMr. Bingley if she could.  But Lizzy!  Oh, sister!  It is very hard\\r\\nto think that she might have been Mr. Collins\\'s wife by this time,\\r\\nhad it not been for her own perverseness.  He made her an offer\\r\\nin this very room, and she refused him.  The consequence of it is,\\r\\nthat Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and\\r\\nthat the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.  The\\r\\nLucases are very artful people indeed, sister.  They are all for\\r\\nwhat they can get.  I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.  It\\r\\nmakes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own\\r\\nfamily, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before\\r\\nanybody else.  However, your coming just at this time is the\\r\\ngreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us,\\r\\nof long sleeves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given\\r\\nbefore, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence\\r\\nwith her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to\\r\\nher nieces, turned the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the\\r\\nsubject.  \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\\r\\nJane,\" said she.  \"I am sorry it went off.  But these things happen\\r\\nso often!  A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so\\r\\neasily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when\\r\\naccident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of\\r\\ninconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but it will\\r\\nnot do for US.  We do not suffer by accident.  It does not often\\r\\nhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young\\r\\nman of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he\\r\\nwas violently in love with only a few days before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so\\r\\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.  It is as\\r\\noften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\\'s\\r\\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.  Pray, how\\r\\nVIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley\\'s love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\r\\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.  Every\\r\\ntime they met, it was more decided and remarkable.  At his own\\r\\nball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them\\r\\nto dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an\\r\\nanswer. Could there be finer symptoms?  Is not general incivility\\r\\nthe very essence of love?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\r\\nPoor Jane!  I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she\\r\\nmay not get over it immediately.  It had better have happened to\\r\\nYOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\r\\nBut do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with\\r\\nus?  Change of scene might be of service-- and perhaps a little\\r\\nrelief from home may be as useful as anything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt\\r\\npersuaded of her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with\\r\\nregard to this young man will influence her.  We live in so\\r\\ndifferent a part of town, all our connections are so different, and,\\r\\nas you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable\\r\\nthat they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of\\r\\nhis friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on\\r\\nJane in such a part of London!  My dear aunt, how could you\\r\\nthink of it?  Mr. Darcy may perhaps have HEARD of such a\\r\\nplace as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a\\r\\nmonth\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were\\r\\nhe once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs\\r\\nwithout him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  I hope they will not meet at all.  But does\\r\\nnot Jane correspond with his sister?  SHE will not be able to\\r\\nhelp calling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place\\r\\nthis point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s\\r\\nbeing withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the\\r\\nsubject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not\\r\\nconsider it entirely hopeless.  It was possible, and sometimes she\\r\\nthought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and\\r\\nthe influence of his friends successfully combated by the more\\r\\nnatural influence of Jane\\'s attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and\\r\\nthe Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time,\\r\\nthan as she hoped by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house\\r\\nwith her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with\\r\\nher, without any danger of seeing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\\r\\nPhillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day\\r\\nwithout its engagement.  Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided\\r\\nfor the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not\\r\\nonce sit down to a family dinner.  When the engagement was for\\r\\nhome, some of the officers always made part of it-- of which\\r\\nofficers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these\\r\\noccasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nwarm commendation, narrowly observed them both.  Without\\r\\nsupposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love,\\r\\ntheir preference of each other was plain enough to make her a\\r\\nlittle uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the\\r\\nsubject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the\\r\\nimprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording\\r\\npleasure, unconnected with his general powers.  About ten or a\\r\\ndozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a\\r\\nconsiderable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he\\r\\nbelonged.  They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common;\\r\\nand though Wickham had been little there since the death of\\r\\nDarcy\\'s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\\r\\nintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\\r\\nprocuring.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberly, and known the late Mr. Darcy\\r\\nby character perfectly well.  Here consequently was an\\r\\ninexhaustible subject of discourse.  In comparing her recollection\\r\\nof Pemberly with the minute description which Wickham could\\r\\ngive, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of\\r\\nits late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.  On\\r\\nbeing made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\\'s treatment\\r\\nof him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\\'s reputed\\r\\ndisposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was\\r\\nconfident at last that she recollected having heard Mr.\\r\\nFitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured\\r\\nboy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 26\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\\r\\ngiven on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her\\r\\nalone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\\r\\nyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of\\r\\nspeaking openly.  Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.\\r\\nDo not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an\\r\\naffection which the want of fortune would make so very\\r\\nimprudent.  I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a most\\r\\ninteresting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to\\r\\nhave, I should think you could not do better.  But as it is, you\\r\\nmust not let your fancy run away with you.  You have sense, and\\r\\nwe all expect you to use it.  Your father would depend on\\r\\nYOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure.  You must not\\r\\ndisappoint your father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.  I will take care of\\r\\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too.  He shall not be in love with\\r\\nme, if I can prevent it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again.  At present I am not in love\\r\\nwith Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.  But he is, beyond all\\r\\ncomparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw-- and if he\\r\\nbecomes really attached to me-- I believe it will be better that he\\r\\nshould not.  I see the imprudence of it.  Oh! THAT abominable\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  My father\\'s opinion of me does me the greatest\\r\\nhonour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.  My father,\\r\\nhowever, is partial to Mr. Wickham.  In short, my dear aunt, I\\r\\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you\\r\\nunhappy; but since we see every day that where there is\\r\\naffection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want\\r\\nof fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how\\r\\ncan I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if\\r\\nI am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be\\r\\nwisdom  to resist?  All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\\r\\nto be in a hurry.  I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\\r\\nobject.  When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.\\r\\nIn short, I will do my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so\\r\\nvery often.  At least, you should not REMIND you mother of\\r\\ninviting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\\r\\n\"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT.  But do\\r\\nnot imagine that he is always here so often.  It is on your\\r\\naccount that he has been so frequently invited this week.  You\\r\\nknow my mother\\'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company\\r\\nfor her friends.  But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do\\r\\nwhat I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\\r\\nher for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful\\r\\ninstance of advice being given on such a point, without being\\r\\nresented.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been\\r\\nquitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode\\r\\nwith the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\r\\nBennet.  His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at\\r\\nlength so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even\\r\\nrepeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \"WISHED they\\r\\nmight be happy.\"  Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on\\r\\nWednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\\r\\nrose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s\\r\\nungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected\\r\\nherself, accompanied her out of the room.  As they went\\r\\ndownstairs together, Charlotte said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THAT you certainly shall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I have another favour to ask you.  Will you come and see\\r\\nme?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.  Promise me,\\r\\ntherefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in\\r\\nthe visit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added\\r\\nCharlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\\r\\nIndeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding took place:  the bride and bridegroom set off for\\r\\nKent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say,\\r\\nor to hear, on the subject as usual.  Elizabeth soon heard from\\r\\nher friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent\\r\\nas it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was\\r\\nimpossible.  Elizabeth could never address her without feeling\\r\\nthat all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined\\r\\nnot to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what\\r\\nhad been, rather than what was.  Charlotte\\'s first letters were\\r\\nreceived with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\r\\ncuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how\\r\\nshe would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare\\r\\npronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read,\\r\\nElizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point\\r\\nexactly as she might have foreseen.  She wrote cheerfully,\\r\\nseemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which\\r\\nshe could not praise.  The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\\r\\nroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was\\r\\nmost friendly and obliging.  It was Mr. Collins\\'s picture of\\r\\nHunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth\\r\\nperceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the\\r\\nrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce\\r\\ntheir safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth\\r\\nhoped it would be in her power to say something of the\\r\\nBingleys.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as\\r\\nimpatience generally is.  Jane had been a week in town without\\r\\neither seeing or hearing from Caroline.  She accounted for it,\\r\\nhowever, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from\\r\\nLongbourn had by some accident been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of\\r\\nthe town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor\\r\\nStreet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\\r\\nBingley.  \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words,\\r\\n\"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving\\r\\nher no notice of my coming to London.  I was right, therefore,\\r\\nmy last letter had never reached her.  I inquired after their\\r\\nbrother, of course.  He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\r\\nDarcy that they scarcely ever saw him.  I found that Miss Darcy\\r\\nwas expected to dinner.  I wish I could see her.  My visit was\\r\\nnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.  I dare say\\r\\nI shall see them soon here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter.  It convinced her that\\r\\naccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\\'s being in\\r\\ntown.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.  She\\r\\nendeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but\\r\\nshe could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention.  After\\r\\nwaiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing\\r\\nevery evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last\\r\\nappear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration\\r\\nof her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.\\r\\nThe letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\\r\\nprove what she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\r\\nher better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to\\r\\nhave been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me.\\r\\nBut, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do\\r\\nnot think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her\\r\\nbehaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.\\r\\nI do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate\\r\\nwith me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I\\r\\nam sure I should be deceived again.  Caroline did not return my\\r\\nvisit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the\\r\\nmeantime.  When she did come, it was very evident that she had\\r\\nno pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\r\\ncalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and\\r\\nwas in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went\\r\\naway I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no\\r\\nlonger.  I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.  She was very\\r\\nwrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every\\r\\nadvance to intimacy began on her side.  But I pity her, because\\r\\nshe must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\\r\\nvery sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.  I need\\r\\nnot explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety to\\r\\nbe quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her\\r\\nbehaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister,\\r\\nwhatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\\r\\namiable.  I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such\\r\\nfears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must\\r\\nhave met, long ago.  He knows of my being in town, I am\\r\\ncertain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem,\\r\\nby her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself\\r\\nthat he is really partial to Miss Darcy.  I cannot understand it.  If\\r\\nI were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted\\r\\nto say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.\\r\\nBut I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think\\r\\nonly of what will make me happy-- your affection, and the\\r\\ninvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.  Let me hear from\\r\\nyou very soon.  Miss Bingley said something of his never\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\\r\\nwith any certainty.  We had better not mention it.  I am\\r\\nextremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our\\r\\nfriends at Hunsford.  Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\\r\\nMaria.  I am sure you will be very comfortable there.-- Yours,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\\r\\nshe considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister\\r\\nat least.  All expectation from the brother was now absolutely\\r\\nover.  She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\r\\nHis character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for\\r\\nhim, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped\\r\\nhe might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\\'s sister, as by Wickham\\'s\\r\\naccount, she would make him abundantly regret what he had\\r\\nthrown away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\r\\nconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and\\r\\nElizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to\\r\\nher aunt than to herself.  His apparent partiality had subsided, his\\r\\nattentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\r\\nElizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it\\r\\nand write of it without material pain.  Her heart had been but\\r\\nslightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that\\r\\nSHE would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.\\r\\nThe sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the\\r\\nmost remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now\\r\\nrendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted\\r\\nperhaps in this case than in Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him\\r\\nfor his wish of independence.  Nothing, on the contrary, could\\r\\nbe more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few\\r\\nstruggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and\\r\\ndesirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\\r\\nhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating\\r\\nthe circumstances, she thus went on:-- \"I am now convinced, my\\r\\ndear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really\\r\\nexperiences that pure and elevating passion, I should at present\\r\\ndetest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.  But my\\r\\nfeelings are not only cordial towards HIM; they are even\\r\\nimpartial towards Miss King.  I cannot find out that I hate her at\\r\\nall, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good\\r\\nsort of girl.  There can be no love in all this.  My watchfulness\\r\\nhas been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\r\\ninteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in\\r\\nlove with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative\\r\\ninsignificance.  Importance may sometimes be purchased too\\r\\ndearly.  Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart\\r\\nthan I do.  They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet\\r\\nopen to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men\\r\\nmust have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 27\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and\\r\\notherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,\\r\\nsometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February\\r\\npass away.  March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.  She had\\r\\nnot at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte,\\r\\nshe soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually\\r\\nlearned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as\\r\\ngreater certainty.  Absence had increased her desire of seeing\\r\\nCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.  There\\r\\nwas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\r\\nuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little\\r\\nchange was not unwelcome for its own sake.  The journey\\r\\nwould moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the\\r\\ntime drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.\\r\\nEverything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled\\r\\naccording to Charlotte\\'s first sketch.  She was to accompany Sir\\r\\nWilliam and his second daughter.  The improvement of spending\\r\\na night in London was added in time, and the plan became\\r\\nperfect as plan could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly\\r\\nmiss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her\\r\\ngoing, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to\\r\\nanswer her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\\r\\nfriendly; on his side even more.  His present pursuit could not\\r\\nmake him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to\\r\\ndeserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be\\r\\nadmired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her\\r\\nevery enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in\\r\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--\\r\\ntheir opinion of everybody-- would always coincide, there was a\\r\\nsolicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him\\r\\nwith a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced\\r\\nthat, whether married or single, he must always be her model of\\r\\nthe amiable and pleasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\r\\nthink him less agreeable.  Sir William Lucas, and his daughter\\r\\nMaria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself,\\r\\nhad nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were\\r\\nlistened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.\\r\\nElizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\'s too\\r\\nlong.  He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his\\r\\npresentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out,\\r\\nlike his information.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\\r\\nearly as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.  As they drove to\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window\\r\\nwatching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was\\r\\nthere to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her\\r\\nface, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.  On the\\r\\nstairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for\\r\\ntheir cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the\\r\\ndrawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for\\r\\na twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.  All was joy and\\r\\nkindness.  The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in\\r\\nbustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.  Their first object was\\r\\nher sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in\\r\\nreply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled\\r\\nto support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.  It was\\r\\nreasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s\\r\\nvisit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations\\r\\noccurring at different times between Jane and herself, which\\r\\nproved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on  Wickham\\'s desertion,\\r\\nand complimented her on bearing it so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss\\r\\nKing?  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\\r\\naffairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?  Where\\r\\ndoes discretion end, and avarice begin?  Last Christmas you\\r\\nwere afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent;\\r\\nand now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten\\r\\nthousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall\\r\\nknow what to think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.  I know no harm of\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\\'s\\r\\ndeath made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- what should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain\\r\\nMY affections because I had no money, what occasion could\\r\\nthere be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about,\\r\\nand who was equally poor?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\\r\\ntowards her so soon after this event.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those\\r\\nelegant decorums which other people may observe.  If SHE does\\r\\nnot object to it, why should WE?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HER not objecting does not justify HIM.  It only shows her\\r\\nbeing deficient in something herself-- sense or feeling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose.  HE shall be\\r\\nmercenary, and SHE shall be foolish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose.  I should be sorry,\\r\\nyou know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in\\r\\nDerbyshire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\\r\\nlive in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\\r\\nHertfordshire are not much better.  I am sick of them all.  Thank\\r\\nHeaven!  I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has\\r\\nnot one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to\\r\\nrecommend him.  Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing,\\r\\nafter all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\\r\\ndisappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she\\r\\nhad the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her\\r\\nuncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking\\r\\nin the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, \"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and\\r\\nher acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what delight!\\r\\nwhat felicity!  You give me fresh life and vigour.  Adieu to\\r\\ndisappointment and spleen.  What are young men to rocks and\\r\\nmountains?  Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend!  And\\r\\nwhen we DO return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\r\\nbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything.  We WILL\\r\\nknow where we have gone-- we WILL recollect what we have\\r\\nseen.  Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together\\r\\nin our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any\\r\\nparticular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative\\r\\nsituation.  Let OUR first effusions be less insupportable than\\r\\nthose of the generality of travellers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 28\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery object in the next day\\'s journey was new and interesting\\r\\nto Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she\\r\\nhad seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her\\r\\nhealth, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant\\r\\nsource of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\\r\\nwas in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to\\r\\nbring it in view.  The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary\\r\\non one side.  Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she\\r\\nhad heard of its inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible.  The garden sloping to\\r\\nthe road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel\\r\\nhedge, everything declared they were arriving.  Mr. Collins and\\r\\nCharlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the\\r\\nsmall gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst\\r\\nthe nods and smiles of the whole party.  In a moment they were\\r\\nall out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.  Mrs.\\r\\nCollins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and\\r\\nElizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she\\r\\nfound herself so affectionately received.  She saw instantly that\\r\\nher cousin\\'s manner were not altered by his marriage; his formal\\r\\ncivility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\r\\nminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all\\r\\nher family.  They were then, with no other delay than his\\r\\npointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house;\\r\\nand as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a\\r\\nsecond time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode,\\r\\nand punctually repeated all his wife\\'s offers of refreshment.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\\r\\nhelp in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the\\r\\nroom, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself\\r\\nparticularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had\\r\\nlost in refusing him.  But though everything seemed neat and\\r\\ncomfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of\\r\\nrepentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she\\r\\ncould have so cheerful an air with such a companion.  When\\r\\nMr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\r\\nashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily\\r\\nturned her eye on Charlotte.  Once of twice she could discern a\\r\\nfaint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.  After\\r\\nsitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the\\r\\nroom, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of\\r\\ntheir journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\r\\nCollins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was\\r\\nlarge and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he\\r\\nattended himself.  To work in this garden was one of his most\\r\\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\\r\\ncountenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of\\r\\nthe exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\r\\nHere, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and\\r\\nscarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked\\r\\nfor, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\\r\\nbeauty entirely behind.  He could number the fields in every\\r\\ndirection, and could tell how many tress there were in the most\\r\\ndistant clump.  But of all the views which his garden, or which\\r\\nthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared\\r\\nwith the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees\\r\\nthat bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.  It\\r\\nwas a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\\r\\nmeadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the\\r\\nremains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William\\r\\naccompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\\r\\nhouse, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\\r\\nof showing it without her husband\\'s help.  It was rather small,\\r\\nbut well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and\\r\\narranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth\\r\\ngave Charlotte all the credit.  When Mr. Collins could be\\r\\nforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout,\\r\\nand by Charlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed\\r\\nhe must be often forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the\\r\\ncountry.  It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when\\r\\nMr. Collins joining in, observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I\\r\\nneed not say you will be delighted with her.  She is all affability\\r\\nand condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured\\r\\nwith some portion of her notice when service is over.  I have\\r\\nscarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my\\r\\nsister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during\\r\\nyour stay here.  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.\\r\\nWe dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\\r\\nwalk home.  Her ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us.\\r\\nI SHOULD say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has\\r\\nseveral.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\\r\\nadded Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.  She is the sort of\\r\\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was  spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire\\r\\nnews, and telling again what had already been written; and when\\r\\nit closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to\\r\\nmeditate upon Charlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand\\r\\nher address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her\\r\\nhusband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.  She\\r\\nhad also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor\\r\\nof their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\r\\nCollins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.  A\\r\\nlively imagination soon settled it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\\r\\nready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the\\r\\nwhole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she\\r\\nheard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling\\r\\nloudly after her.  She opened the door and met Maria in the\\r\\nlanding place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\\r\\ndining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!  I will not tell\\r\\nyou what it is.  Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\\r\\nmore, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted\\r\\nthe lane, in quest of this wonder!  It was two ladies stopping in a\\r\\nlow phaeton at the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I expected at least that the\\r\\npigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady\\r\\nCatherine and her daughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is\\r\\nnot Lady Catherine.  The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives\\r\\nwith them; the other is Miss de Bourgh.  Only look at her.  She\\r\\nis quite a little creature.  Who would have thought that she could\\r\\nbe so thin and small?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this\\r\\nwind.  Why does she not come in?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.  It is the greatest of\\r\\nfavours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\r\\n\"She looks sickly and cross.  Yes, she will do for him very well.\\r\\nShe will make him a very proper wife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\\r\\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high\\r\\ndiversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest\\r\\ncontemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly\\r\\nbowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\\r\\nand the others returned into the house.  Mr. Collins no sooner\\r\\nsaw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their\\r\\ngood fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know\\r\\nthat the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 29\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\\r\\ncomplete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\\r\\nto his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\\r\\ntowards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished\\r\\nfor; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon,\\r\\nwas such an instance of Lady Catherine\\'s condescension, as he\\r\\nknew not how to admire enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised\\r\\nby her ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the\\r\\nevening at Rosings.  I rather expected, from my knowledge of\\r\\nher affability, that it would happen.  But who could have\\r\\nforeseen such an attention as this?  Who could have imagined\\r\\nthat we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation,\\r\\nmoreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your\\r\\narrival!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir\\r\\nWilliam, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great\\r\\nreally are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\r\\nAbout the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\\r\\nuncommon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning\\r\\nbut their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\\r\\nthem in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\\r\\nso many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\\r\\noverpower them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette. Her said to\\r\\nElizabeth--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your\\r\\napparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of\\r\\ndress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.  I would\\r\\nadvise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior\\r\\nto the rest-- there is no occasion for anything more.  Lady\\r\\nCatherine will not think the worse of you for being simply\\r\\ndressed.  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\\r\\ndifferent doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\r\\nSuch formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\\r\\nliving, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\\r\\ncompany, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\\r\\nwith as much apprehension as her father had done to his\\r\\npresentation at St. James\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\r\\nmile across the park.  Every park has its beauty and its\\r\\nprospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though\\r\\nshe could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the\\r\\nscene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration\\r\\nof the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\\r\\nglazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was\\r\\nevery moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look\\r\\nperfectly calm.  Elizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her.  She had\\r\\nheard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any\\r\\nextraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere\\r\\nstateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness\\r\\nwithout trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\r\\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\\r\\nthey followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\\r\\nwhere Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\\r\\nsitting.  Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\\r\\nthem; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the\\r\\noffice of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\\r\\nproper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which\\r\\nhe would have thought necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of having been at St. James\\'s Sir William was so\\r\\ncompletely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had\\r\\nbut just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his\\r\\nseat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost\\r\\nout of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing\\r\\nwhich way to look.  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the\\r\\nscene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.\\r\\nLady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\\r\\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome.  Her air was\\r\\nnot conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as\\r\\nto make her visitors forget their inferior rank.  She was not\\r\\nrendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was\\r\\nspoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance,\\r\\nand brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and\\r\\nfrom the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady\\r\\nCatherine to be exactly what he represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\\r\\ndeportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nshe turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have\\r\\njoined in Maria\\'s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.\\r\\nThere was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the\\r\\nladies.  Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though\\r\\nnot plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in\\r\\na low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was\\r\\nnothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to\\r\\nwhat she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\\r\\nher eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\\r\\nwindows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to\\r\\npoint out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them\\r\\nthat it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\\r\\nservants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\\r\\npromised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\\r\\nthe bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if\\r\\nhe felt that life could furnish nothing greater.  He carved, and\\r\\nate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\\r\\ncommended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\\r\\nenough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\r\\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\r\\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive\\r\\nadmiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any\\r\\ndish on the table proved a novelty to them.  The party did not\\r\\nsupply much conversation.  Elizabeth was ready to speak\\r\\nwhenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\\r\\nCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh-- the former of whom was\\r\\nengaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a\\r\\nword to her all dinner-time.  Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly\\r\\nemployed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing\\r\\nher to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.\\r\\nMaria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen\\r\\ndid nothing but eat and admire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little\\r\\nto be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did\\r\\nwithout any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her\\r\\nopinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that\\r\\nshe was not used to have her judgement controverted.  She\\r\\ninquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic concerns familiarly and\\r\\nminutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management\\r\\nof them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so\\r\\nsmall a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her\\r\\ncows and her poultry.  Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath\\r\\nthis great lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an\\r\\noccasion of dictating to others.  In the intervals of her discourse\\r\\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria\\r\\nand Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections\\r\\nshe knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a\\r\\nvery genteel, pretty kind of girl.  She asked her, at different\\r\\ntimes, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or\\r\\nyounger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be\\r\\nmarried, whether they were handsome, where they had been\\r\\neducated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\\r\\nmother\\'s maiden name?  Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\\r\\nquestions but answered them very composedly.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nthen observed,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.  For\\r\\nyour sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I\\r\\nsee no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.  It was\\r\\nnot thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family.  Do you\\r\\nplay and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! then-- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.\\r\\nOur instrument is a capital one, probably superior to---- You\\r\\nshall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One of them does.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did not you all learn?  You ought all to have learned.  The\\r\\nMiss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\\r\\nas yours.  Do you draw?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very strange.  But I suppose you had no opportunity.\\r\\nYour mother should have taken you to town every spring for the\\r\\nbenefit of masters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\\r\\nLondon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No governess!  How was that possible? Five daughters brought\\r\\nup at home without a governess!  I never heard of such a thing.\\r\\nYour mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\\r\\nnot been the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, who taught you?  who attended to you?  Without a\\r\\ngoverness, you must have been neglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\\r\\nas wished to learn never wanted the means.  We were always\\r\\nencouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\r\\nThose who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if\\r\\nI had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\r\\nstrenuously to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be\\r\\ndone in education without steady and regular instruction, and\\r\\nnobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many\\r\\nfamilies I have been the means of supplying in that way.  I am\\r\\nalways glad to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces\\r\\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my\\r\\nmeans; and it was but the other day that I recommended another\\r\\nyoung person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me,\\r\\nand the family are quite delighted with her.  Mrs. Collins, did I\\r\\ntell you of Lady Metcalf\\'s calling yesterday to thank me?  She\\r\\nfinds Miss Pope a treasure.  \\'Lady Catherine,\\' said she, \\'you\\r\\nhave given me a treasure.\\'  Are any of your younger sisters out,\\r\\nMiss Bennet?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All!  What, all five out at once?  Very odd!  And you only the\\r\\nsecond.  The younger ones out before the elder ones are\\r\\nmarried!  Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps SHE is full young to\\r\\nbe much in company.  But really, ma\\'am, I think it would be\\r\\nvery hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their\\r\\nshare of society and amusement, because the elder may not have\\r\\nthe means or inclination to marry early.  The last-born has as\\r\\ngood a right to the pleasures of youth at the first.  And to be\\r\\nkept back on SUCH a motive!  I think it would not be very likely\\r\\nto promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very\\r\\ndecidedly for so young a person.  Pray, what is your age?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nsmiling, \"your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\\r\\nanswer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\\r\\nwho had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified\\r\\nimpertinence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\\r\\nnot conceal your age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\\r\\ncard-tables were placed.  Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh\\r\\nchose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of\\r\\nassisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.  Their table was\\r\\nsuperlatively stupid.  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not\\r\\nrelate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\\r\\nfears of Miss de Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or having\\r\\ntoo much or too little light.  A great deal more passed at the\\r\\nother table.  Lady Catherine was generally speaking-- stating the\\r\\nmistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\\r\\nherself.  Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her\\r\\nladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\\r\\napologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir William did not\\r\\nsay much.  He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\\r\\nnames.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as\\r\\nthey chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.\\r\\nThe party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\\r\\ndetermine what weather they were to have on the morrow.\\r\\nFrom these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of\\r\\nthe coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\r\\nCollins\\'s side and as many bows on Sir William\\'s they departed.\\r\\nAs soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called\\r\\non by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at\\r\\nRosings, which, for Charlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable\\r\\nthan it really was.  But her commendation, though costing her\\r\\nsome trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was\\r\\nvery soon obliged to take her ladyship\\'s praise into his own\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 30\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was\\r\\nlong enough to convince him of his daughter\\'s being most\\r\\ncomfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\\r\\nsuch a neighbour as were not often met with.  While Sir William\\r\\nwas with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him\\r\\nout in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went\\r\\naway, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\\r\\nElizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\r\\ncousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between\\r\\nbreakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in\\r\\nthe garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the\\r\\nwindow in his own book-room, which fronted the road.  The\\r\\nroom in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at\\r\\nfirst rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the\\r\\ndining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and\\r\\nhad a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had\\r\\nan excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would\\r\\nundoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they\\r\\nsat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the\\r\\narrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the\\r\\nlane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of\\r\\nwhat carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de\\r\\nBourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming\\r\\nto inform them of, though it happened almost every day.  She\\r\\nnot unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\\r\\nprevailed upon to get out.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\\r\\nRosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\\r\\nnecessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there\\r\\nmight be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not\\r\\nunderstand the sacrifice of so many hours.  Now and then they\\r\\nwere honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing\\r\\nescaped her observation that was passing in the room during\\r\\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at\\r\\ntheir work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault\\r\\nwith the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid\\r\\nin negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do\\r\\nit only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\\'s joints of\\r\\n\\r\\neat were too large for her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\r\\ncommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active\\r\\nmagistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which\\r\\nwere carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the\\r\\ncottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too\\r\\npoor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,\\r\\nsilence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and\\r\\nplenty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice\\r\\na week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being\\r\\nonly one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was\\r\\nthe counterpart of the first.  Their other engagements were few,\\r\\nas the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond\\r\\nMr. Collins\\'s reach.  This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth,\\r\\nand upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough;\\r\\nthere were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte,\\r\\nand the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\\r\\noften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and\\r\\nwhere she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady\\r\\nCatherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of\\r\\nthe park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one\\r\\nseemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed\\r\\naway.  Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was\\r\\nto bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a\\r\\ncircle must be important.  Elizabeth had heard soon after her\\r\\narrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few\\r\\nweeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances\\r\\nwhom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one\\r\\ncomparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she\\r\\nmight be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs\\r\\non him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was\\r\\nevidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming\\r\\nwith the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the\\r\\nhighest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had\\r\\nalready been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins\\r\\nwas walking the whole morning within view of the lodges\\r\\nopening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest\\r\\n\\r\\nassurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned\\r\\ninto the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.  On the\\r\\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.\\r\\nThere were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\\r\\nMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the\\r\\nyounger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of\\r\\nall the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman\\r\\naccompanied him.  Charlotte had seen them from her husband\\'s\\r\\nroom, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other,\\r\\ntold the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nwould never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the\\r\\ncompliment, before their approach was announced by the\\r\\ndoor-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered\\r\\nthe room.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about\\r\\nthirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the\\r\\ngentleman . Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look\\r\\nin Hertfordshire-- paid his compliments, with his usual reserve,\\r\\nto Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\r\\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth\\r\\nmerely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\r\\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very\\r\\npleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight\\r\\nobservation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for\\r\\nsome time without speaking to anybody.  At length, however,\\r\\nhis civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after\\r\\nthe health of her family.  She answered him in the usual way,\\r\\nand after a moment\\'s pause, added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.  Have\\r\\nyou never happened to see her there?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\\r\\nsee whether he would betray any consciousness of what had\\r\\npassed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he\\r\\nlooked a little confused as he answered that he had never been\\r\\nso fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.  The subject was pursued\\r\\nno farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 31\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners were very much admired at the\\r\\nParsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably\\r\\nto the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.  It was some\\r\\ndays, however, before they received any invitation thither-- for\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile there were visitors in the house, they could not be\\r\\nnecessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the\\r\\ngentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an\\r\\nattention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\r\\ncome there in the evening.  For the last week they had seen very\\r\\nlittle of Lady Catherine or her daughter.  Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\r\\ncalled at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\r\\nDarcy they had seen only at church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\\r\\njoined the party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room.  Her ladyship\\r\\nreceived them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by\\r\\nno means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and\\r\\nshe was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to\\r\\nthem, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person\\r\\nin the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything\\r\\nwas a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\\'s\\r\\npretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.  He now\\r\\nseated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and\\r\\nHertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books\\r\\nand music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained\\r\\nin that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and\\r\\nflow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well\\r\\nas of Mr. Darcy.  HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\r\\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,\\r\\nafter a while, shared the feeling, was more openly\\r\\nacknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?  What is it you are\\r\\ntalking of?  What are you telling Miss Bennet?  Let me hear\\r\\nwhat it is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer\\r\\nable to avoid a reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of music!  Then pray speak aloud.  It is of all subjects my\\r\\n\\r\\ndelight.  I must have my share in the conversation if you are\\r\\nspeaking of music.  There are few people in England, I suppose,\\r\\nwho have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better\\r\\nnatural taste.  If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great\\r\\nproficient.  And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to\\r\\napply.  I am confident that she would have performed\\r\\ndelightfully.  How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s\\r\\nproficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\\r\\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to\\r\\nexcel if she does not practice a good deal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such\\r\\nadvice.  She practises very constantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So much the better.  It cannot be done too much; and when I\\r\\nnext write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\\r\\naccount.  I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is\\r\\nto be acquired without constant practice.  I have told Miss\\r\\nBennet several times, that she will never play really well unless\\r\\nshe practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument,\\r\\nshe is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to\\r\\nRosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\r\\nJenkinson\\'s room.  She would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in\\r\\nthat part of the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill-breeding, and\\r\\nmade no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth\\r\\nof having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to\\r\\nthe instrument.  He drew a chair near her.  Lady Catherine\\r\\nlistened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other\\r\\nnephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with\\r\\nhis usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so\\r\\nas to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s countenance.\\r\\nElizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient\\r\\npause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state\\r\\nto hear me?  I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play\\r\\nso well.  There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to\\r\\n\\r\\nbe frightened at the will of others.  My courage always rises at\\r\\nevery attempt to intimidate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you\\r\\ncould not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming\\r\\nyou; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long\\r\\nenough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally\\r\\nprofessing opinions which in fact are not your own.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty\\r\\nnotion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.  I am\\r\\nparticularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose\\r\\nmy real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to\\r\\npass myself off with some degree of credit.  Indeed, Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nit is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my\\r\\ndisadvantage in Hertfordshire-- and, give me leave to say, very\\r\\nimpolitic too-- for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things\\r\\nmay come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam.  \"I should like to know how he behaves\\r\\namong strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You shall hear then-- but prepare yourself for something very\\r\\ndreadful.  The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nyou must know, was at a ball-- and at this ball, what do you\\r\\nthink he did?  He danced only four dances, though gentlemen\\r\\nwere scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one\\r\\nyoung lady was sitting down in want of a partner.  Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nyou cannot deny the fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the\\r\\nassembly beyond my own party.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.  Well,\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?  My fingers wait your\\r\\norders.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I\\r\\nsought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend\\r\\nmyself to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\nstill addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.  \"Shall we ask him why a\\r\\nman of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill\\r\\nqualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without\\r\\napplying to him.  It is because he will not give himself the\\r\\ntrouble.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in\\r\\ntheir concerns, as I often see done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument\\r\\nin the masterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do.  They\\r\\nhave not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the\\r\\nsame expression.  But then I have always supposed it to be my\\r\\nown fault-- because I will not take the trouble of practising.  It is\\r\\nnot that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other\\r\\nwoman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right.  You have\\r\\nemployed your time much better.  No one admitted to the\\r\\nprivilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.  We neither\\r\\nof us perform to strangers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\\r\\nknow what they were talking of.  Elizabeth immediately began\\r\\nplaying again.  Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening\\r\\nfor a few minutes, said to Darcy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,\\r\\nand could have the advantage of a London master.  She has a\\r\\nvery good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to\\r\\nAnne\\'s.  Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her\\r\\nhealth allowed her to learn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other\\r\\ncould she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of\\r\\nhis behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for\\r\\nMiss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry\\r\\nHER, had she been his relation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nperformance, mixing with them many instructions on execution\\r\\nand taste.  Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of\\r\\ncivility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the\\r\\ninstrument till her ladyship\\'s carriage was ready to take them all\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 32\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\\r\\nJane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into\\r\\nthe village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the\\r\\ncertain signal of a visitor.  As she had heard no carriage, she\\r\\nthought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that\\r\\napprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she\\r\\nmight escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened,\\r\\nand, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,\\r\\nentered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised\\r\\nfor his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all\\r\\nthe ladies were to be within.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were\\r\\nmade, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.  It was\\r\\nabsolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this\\r\\nemergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him last in\\r\\nHertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say\\r\\non the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.\\r\\nBingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right,\\r\\nhe went but the day before.  He and his sisters were well, I hope,\\r\\nwhen you left London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a\\r\\nshort pause added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\\r\\never returning to Netherfield again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may\\r\\nspend very little of his time there in the future.  He has many\\r\\nfriends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are\\r\\ncontinually increasing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\\r\\nthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for\\r\\nthen we might possibly get a settled family there.  But, perhaps,\\r\\nMr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience\\r\\nof the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to\\r\\nkeep it or quit it on the same principle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up\\r\\nas soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer.  She was afraid of talking longer of\\r\\nhis friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined\\r\\nto leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very\\r\\ncomfortable house.  Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to\\r\\nit when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe she did-- and I am sure she could not have bestowed\\r\\nher kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\\r\\nwife.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\\r\\none of the very few sensible women who would have accepted\\r\\nhim, or have made him happy if they had.  My friend has an\\r\\nexcellent understanding-- though I am not certain that I consider\\r\\nher marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.  She\\r\\nseems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is\\r\\ncertainly a very good match for her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\r\\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"An easy distance, do you call it?  It is nearly fifty miles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road?  Little more than half a\\r\\nday\\'s journey.  Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI should never have considered the distance as one of the\\r\\nADVANTAGES of the match,\" cried Elizabeth.  \"I should never\\r\\nhave said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\\r\\nAnything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I\\r\\nsuppose, would appear far.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied\\r\\nshe understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane\\r\\nand Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\\r\\nher family.  The far and the near must be relative, and depend on\\r\\nmany varying circumstances.  Where there is fortune to make the\\r\\nexpenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.\\r\\nBut that is not the case HERE.  Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a\\r\\ncomfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent\\r\\njourneys-- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself\\r\\nNEAR her family under less than HALF the present distance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"YOU\\r\\ncannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.  YOU\\r\\ncannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked surprised.  The gentleman experienced some\\r\\nchange of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper\\r\\nfrom the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the county ensued, on either\\r\\nside calm and concise-- and soon put an end to by the entrance\\r\\nof Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk.  The\\r\\ntete-a-tete surprised them.  Mr. Darcy related the mistake which\\r\\nhad occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a\\r\\nfew minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone.  \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he\\r\\nwould never have called us in this familiar way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very\\r\\nlikely, even to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after\\r\\nvarious conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to\\r\\n\\r\\nproceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was\\r\\nthe more probable from the time of year.  All field sports were\\r\\nover.  Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a\\r\\nbilliard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and\\r\\nin the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk\\r\\nto it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\\r\\ntemptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\r\\nThey called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\r\\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied\\r\\nby their aunt.  It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\ncame because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion\\r\\nwhich of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was\\r\\nreminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by\\r\\nhis evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George\\r\\nWickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was\\r\\nless captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners, she\\r\\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\\r\\ndifficult to understand.  It could not be for society, as he\\r\\nfrequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his\\r\\nlips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity\\r\\nrather than of choice-- a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure  to\\r\\nhimself.  He seldom appeared really animated.  Mrs. Collins\\r\\nknew not what to make of him.  Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s\\r\\noccasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\\r\\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not\\r\\nhave told her; and as she would liked to have believed this\\r\\nchange the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend\\r\\nEliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.  She\\r\\nwatched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he\\r\\ncame to Hunsford; but without much success.  He certainly\\r\\nlooked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look\\r\\nwas disputable.  It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\\r\\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and\\r\\nsometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of\\r\\nhis being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;\\r\\nand Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from\\r\\nthe danger of raising expectations which might only end in\\r\\ndisappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt,\\r\\nthat all her friend\\'s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose\\r\\nhim to be in her power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her\\r\\nmarrying colonel Fitzwilliam.  He was beyond comparison the\\r\\nmost pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in\\r\\nlife was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages,\\r\\nMr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his\\r\\ncousin could have none at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 33\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\r\\nunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.  She felt all the perverseness of\\r\\nthe mischance that should bring him where no one else was\\r\\nbrought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to\\r\\ninform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.  How it\\r\\ncould occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!  Yet it did,\\r\\nand even a third.  It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary\\r\\npenance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal\\r\\ninquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually\\r\\nthought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.  He never\\r\\nsaid a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\\r\\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\\r\\nrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--\\r\\nabout her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary\\r\\nwalks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\\'s happiness; and\\r\\nthat in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding\\r\\nthe house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into\\r\\nKent again she would be staying THERE too.  His words\\r\\nseemed to imply it.  Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his\\r\\nthoughts?  She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean\\r\\nand allusion to what might arise in that quarter.  It distressed\\r\\nher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in\\r\\nthe pales opposite the Parsonage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked in perusing Jane\\'s last\\r\\nletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane\\r\\nhad not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised\\r\\nby Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\r\\nwas meeting her.  Putting away the letter immediately and\\r\\nforcing a smile, she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I\\r\\n\\r\\ngenerally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the\\r\\nParsonage.  Are you going much farther?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\\r\\nParsonage together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes-- if Darcy does not put it off again.  But I am at his\\r\\ndisposal.  He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\\r\\nleast pleasure in the great power of choice.  I do not know\\r\\nanybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he\\r\\nlikes than Mr. Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam.  \"But so we all do.  It is only that he has better\\r\\nmeans of having it than many others, because he is rich, and\\r\\nmany others are poor.  I speak feelingly.  A younger son, you\\r\\nknow, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little\\r\\nof either.  Now seriously, what have you ever known of\\r\\nself-denial and dependence?  When have you been prevented by\\r\\nwant of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring\\r\\nanything you had a fancy for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are home questions-- and perhaps I cannot say that I\\r\\nhave experienced many hardships of that nature.  But in matters\\r\\nof greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.  Younger\\r\\nsons cannot marry where they like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they\\r\\nvery often do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too\\r\\nmany in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some\\r\\nattention to money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured\\r\\nat the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And\\r\\npray, what is the usual price of an earl\\'s younger son?  Unless\\r\\n\\r\\nthe elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask\\r\\nabove fifty thousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.  To\\r\\ninterrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with\\r\\nwhat had passed, she soon afterwards said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for\\r\\nthe sake of  having someone at his disposal.  I wonder he does\\r\\nnot marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.  But,\\r\\nperhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is\\r\\nunder his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he\\r\\nmust divide with me.  I am joined with him in the guardianship\\r\\nof Miss Darcy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you indeed?  And pray what sort of guardians do you\\r\\nmake?  Does your charge give you much trouble?  Young ladies\\r\\nof her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she\\r\\nhas the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\\r\\nmanner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed\\r\\nMiss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her\\r\\nthat she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.  She\\r\\ndirectly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not be frightened.  I never heard any harm of her; and\\r\\nI dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\r\\nShe is a very great favourite with some ladies of my\\r\\nacquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.  I think I have heard\\r\\nyou say that you know them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know them a little.  Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\\r\\nman-- he is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind\\r\\nto Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Care of him!  Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care of\\r\\nhim in those points where he most wants care.  From something\\r\\nthat he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think\\r\\nBingley very much indebted to him.  But I ought to beg his\\r\\npardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the\\r\\n\\r\\nperson meant.  It was all conjecture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\\r\\nknown, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it\\r\\nwould be an unpleasant thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to\\r\\nbe Bingley.  What he told me was merely this: that he\\r\\ncongratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the\\r\\ninconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without\\r\\nmentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected\\r\\nit to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get\\r\\ninto a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been\\r\\ntogether the whole of last summer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections\\r\\nagainst the lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling.\\r\\n\"He only told me what I have now told you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling\\r\\nwith indignation.  After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked\\r\\nher why she was so thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Your cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings.  Why was he\\r\\nto be the judge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the\\r\\npropriety of his friend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own\\r\\njudgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner\\r\\nhis friend was to be happy.  But,\" she continued, recollecting\\r\\nherself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to\\r\\ncondemn him.  It is not to be supposed that there was much\\r\\n\\r\\naffection in the case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\\r\\nlessening of the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer,\\r\\nand therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on\\r\\nindifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.  There, shut\\r\\ninto her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could\\r\\nthink without interruption of all that she had heard.  It was not\\r\\nto be supposed that any other people could be meant than those\\r\\nwith whom she was connected.  There could not exist in the\\r\\nworld TWO men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such\\r\\nboundless influence.  That he had been concerned in the\\r\\nmeasures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never\\r\\ndoubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the\\r\\nprincipal design and arrangement of them.  If his own vanity,\\r\\nhowever,  did not mislead him, HE was the cause, his pride and\\r\\ncaprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still\\r\\ncontinued to suffer.  He had ruined for a while every hope of\\r\\nhappiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world;\\r\\nand no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\" were\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s words; and those strong objections\\r\\nprobably were, her having one uncle who was a country\\r\\nattorney, and another who was in business in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility\\r\\nof objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!-- her\\r\\nunderstanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners\\r\\ncaptivating.  Neither could anything be urged against my father,\\r\\nwho, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself need not disdain, and respectability which he will\\r\\nprobably never each.\"  When she thought of her mother, her\\r\\nconfidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any\\r\\nobjections THERE had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\r\\npride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\\r\\nthe want of importance in his friend\\'s connections, than from\\r\\ntheir want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he\\r\\nhad been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly\\r\\nby the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on\\r\\na headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening,\\r\\nthat, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined\\r\\nher not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were\\r\\nengaged to drink tea.  Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really\\r\\nunwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible\\r\\nprevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could\\r\\nnot conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather\\r\\ndispleased by her staying at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 34\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate\\r\\nherself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her\\r\\nemployment the examination of all the letters which Jane had\\r\\nwritten to her since her being in Kent.  They contained no actual\\r\\ncomplaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any\\r\\ncommunication of present suffering.  But in all, and in almost\\r\\nevery line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which\\r\\nhad been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding\\r\\nfrom the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\r\\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\r\\nElizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of\\r\\nuneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the\\r\\nfirst perusal.  Mr. Darcy\\'s shameful boast of what misery he had\\r\\nbeen able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister\\'s\\r\\nsufferings.  It was some consolation to think that his visit to\\r\\nRosings was to end on the day after the next-- and, a still\\r\\ngreater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with\\r\\nJane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\r\\nspirits, by all that affection could do.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent without\\r\\nremembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and\\r\\nagreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound\\r\\nof the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea\\r\\nof its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before\\r\\ncalled late in the evening, and might now come to inquire\\r\\nparticularly after her.  But this idea was soon banished, and her\\r\\n\\r\\nspirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter\\r\\namazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.  In an\\r\\nhurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health,\\r\\nimputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.  She\\r\\nanswered him with cold civility.  He sat down for a few\\r\\nmoments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\\r\\nElizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.  After a silence of\\r\\nseveral minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and\\r\\nthus began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In vain I have struggled.  It will not do.  My feelings will not be\\r\\nrepressed.  You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire\\r\\nand love you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression.  She stared,\\r\\ncoloured, doubted, and was silent.  This he considered sufficient\\r\\nencouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long\\r\\nfelt for her, immediately followed.  He spoke well; but there\\r\\nwere feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he\\r\\nwas not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of\\r\\npride.  His sense of her inferiority-- of its being a degradation--\\r\\nof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination,\\r\\nwere dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\\r\\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\\r\\nrecommend his suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible\\r\\nto the compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her\\r\\nintentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for\\r\\nthe pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his\\r\\nsubsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.  She\\r\\ntried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience,\\r\\nwhen he should have done.  He concluded with representing to\\r\\nher the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his\\r\\nendeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\\r\\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her\\r\\nacceptance of his hand.  As he said this, she could easily see that\\r\\nhe had no doubt of a favourable answer.  He SPOKE of\\r\\napprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\\r\\nsecurity.  Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther,\\r\\nand, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\r\\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever unequally they may be returned.  It is natural that\\r\\nobligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I would\\r\\nnow thank you.  But I cannot-- I have never desired your good\\r\\nopinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.  I\\r\\n\\r\\nam sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.  It has been most\\r\\nunconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short\\r\\nduration.  The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\\r\\nthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\\r\\novercoming it after this explanation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his\\r\\neyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less\\r\\nresentment than surprise.  His complexion became pale with\\r\\nanger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every\\r\\nfeature.  He was struggling for the appearance of composure,\\r\\nand would not open his lips till he believed himself to have\\r\\nattained it.  The pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings dreadful.  At\\r\\nlength, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is the reply which I am to have the honour of\\r\\nexpecting:  I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\\r\\nlittle ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected.  But it is of\\r\\nsmall importance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \" why with so evident a\\r\\ndesire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that\\r\\nyou liked me against your will, against your reason, and even\\r\\nagainst your character?  Was not this some excuse for incivility,\\r\\nif I WAS uncivil?  But I have other provocations.  You know I\\r\\nhave.  Had not my feelings decided against you-- had they been\\r\\nindifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\\r\\nany consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\r\\nbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a\\r\\nmost beloved sister?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but\\r\\nthe emotion was short, and he listened without attempting\\r\\nto interrupt her while she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.  No motive\\r\\ncan excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted THERE.\\r\\nYou dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal,\\r\\nif not the only means of dividing them from each other-- of\\r\\nexposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and\\r\\n\\r\\ninstability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes,\\r\\nand involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\\r\\nlistening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any\\r\\nfeeling of remorse.  He even looked at her with a smile of\\r\\naffected incredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of\\r\\ndenying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend\\r\\nfrom your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.  Towards HIM I\\r\\nhave been kinder than towards myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil\\r\\nreflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\\r\\nconciliate her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my\\r\\ndislike is founded.  Long before it had taken place my opinion of\\r\\nyou was decided.  Your character was unfolded in the recital\\r\\nwhich I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.  On this\\r\\nsubject, what can you have to say?  In what imaginary act of\\r\\nfriendship can you here defend yourself?  or under what\\r\\nmisrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns,\" said\\r\\nDarcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help\\r\\nfeeling an interest in him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his\\r\\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy.  \"You\\r\\nhave reduced him to his present state of poverty-- comparative\\r\\npoverty.  You have withheld the advantages which you must\\r\\nknow to have been designed for him.  You have deprived the\\r\\nbest years of his life of that independence which was no less his\\r\\ndue than his desert.  You have done all this!  and yet you can\\r\\ntreat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room, \"Is your opinion of me!  This is the estimation in\\r\\nwhich you hold me!  I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My\\r\\nfaults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!  But\\r\\nperhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards\\r\\nher, \"these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your\\r\\npride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had\\r\\nlong prevented my forming any serious design.  These bitter\\r\\naccusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\\r\\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief\\r\\nof my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by\\r\\nreason, by reflection, by everything.  But disguise of every sort is\\r\\nmy abhorrence.  Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.\\r\\nThey were natural and just.  Could you expect me to rejoice in\\r\\nthe inferiority of your connections?-- to congratulate myself on\\r\\nthe hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly\\r\\nbeneath my own?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\\r\\ntried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of\\r\\nyour declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared\\r\\nthe concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you\\r\\nbehaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\\r\\nway that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with\\r\\nan expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.  She went\\r\\non:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the very beginning-- from the first moment, I may almost\\r\\nsay-- of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me\\r\\nwith the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your\\r\\nselfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the\\r\\ngroundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have\\r\\nbuilt so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month\\r\\nbefore I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I\\r\\ncould ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam.  I perfectly comprehend\\r\\nyour feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own\\r\\n\\r\\nhave been.  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your\\r\\ntime, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth\\r\\nheard him the next moment open the front door and quit the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.  She knew not\\r\\nhow to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and\\r\\ncried for half-an-hour.  Her astonishment, as she reflected on\\r\\nwhat had passed, was increased by every review of it.  That she\\r\\nshould receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!  That he\\r\\nshould have been in love with her for so many months!  So much\\r\\nin love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\\r\\nwhich had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying her sister, and\\r\\nwhich must appear at least with equal force in his own case--\\r\\nwas almost incredible!  It was gratifying to have inspired\\r\\nunconsciously so strong an affection.  But his pride, his\\r\\nabominable pride-- his shameless avowal of what he had done\\r\\nwith respect to Jane-- his unpardonable assurance in\\r\\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling\\r\\nmanner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty\\r\\ntowards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the\\r\\npity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment\\r\\nexcited.  She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound\\r\\nof Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was\\r\\nto encounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to\\r\\nher room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 35\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and\\r\\nmeditations which had at length closed her eyes.  She could not\\r\\nyet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was\\r\\nimpossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for\\r\\nemployment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge\\r\\nherself in air and exercise.  She was proceeding directly to her\\r\\nfavourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\\'s sometimes\\r\\ncoming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she\\r\\nturned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road.\\r\\nThe park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\\r\\npassed one of the gates into the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she\\r\\nwas tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the\\r\\ngates and look into the park.  The five weeks which she had now\\r\\npassed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and\\r\\nevery day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.  She was\\r\\non the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse\\r\\nof a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he\\r\\nwas moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was\\r\\ndirectly retreating.  But the person who advanced was now near\\r\\nenough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\r\\npronounced her name.  She had turned away; but on hearing\\r\\nherself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she moved again towards the gate.  He had by that time\\r\\nreached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively\\r\\ntook, said, with a look of haughty composure, \"I have been\\r\\nwalking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.  Will\\r\\nyou do me the honour of reading that letter?\"  And then, with a\\r\\nslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\\r\\nElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\\r\\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper,\\r\\nwritten quite through, in a very close hand.  The envelope itself\\r\\nwas likewise full.  Pursuing her way along the lane, she then\\r\\nbegan it.  It was dated from Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning, and was as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\\r\\napprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments\\r\\nor renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to\\r\\nyou.  I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\\r\\nmyself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,\\r\\ncannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation\\r\\nand the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\\r\\nspared had not my character required it to be written and read.\\r\\nYou must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\\r\\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly,\\r\\nbut I demand it of your justice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of\\r\\nequal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.  The first\\r\\nmentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had\\r\\ndetached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had,\\r\\nin defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\\r\\n\\r\\nhumanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\\r\\nprospects of Mr. Wickham.  Wilfully and wantonly to have\\r\\nthrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\\r\\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\\r\\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought\\r\\nup to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the\\r\\nseparation of two young persons, whose affection could be the\\r\\ngrowth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.  But\\r\\nfrom the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally\\r\\nbestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the\\r\\nfuture secured, when the following account of my actions and\\r\\ntheir motives has been read.  If, in the explanation of them,\\r\\nwhich is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating\\r\\nfeelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I\\r\\nam sorry.  The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology\\r\\nwould be absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\\r\\nwith others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other\\r\\nyoung woman in the country.  But it was not till the evening of\\r\\nthe dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his\\r\\nfeeling a serious attachment.  I had often seen him in love before.\\r\\nAt that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was\\r\\nfirst made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\'s accidental\\r\\ninformation, that Bingley\\'s attentions to your sister had given\\r\\nrise to a general expectation of their marriage.  He spoke of it as\\r\\na certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\r\\n>From that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour attentively;\\r\\nand I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\\r\\nbeyond what I had ever witnessed in him.  Your sister I also\\r\\nwatched.  Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and\\r\\nengaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard,\\r\\nand I remained convinced from the evening\\'s scrutiny, that\\r\\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not\\r\\ninvite them by any participation of sentiment.  If YOU have not\\r\\nbeen mistaken here, I must have been in error.  Your superior\\r\\nknowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.  If it be\\r\\nso, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your\\r\\nresentment has not been unreasonable.  But I shall not scruple to\\r\\nassert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and air was\\r\\nsuch as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\\r\\nthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\\r\\neasily touched.  That I was desirous of believing her indifferent\\r\\nis certain-- but I will venture to say that my investigation and\\r\\ndecisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.  I did\\r\\n\\r\\nnot believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it\\r\\non impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.  My\\r\\nobjections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\\r\\nnight acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put\\r\\naside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so\\r\\ngreat an evil to my friend as to me.  But there were other causes\\r\\nof repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing\\r\\nto an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured\\r\\nto forget, because they were not immediately before me.  These\\r\\ncauses must be stated, though briefly.  The situation of your\\r\\nmother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\r\\ncomparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so\\r\\nalmost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger\\r\\nsisters, and occasionally even by your father.  Pardon me.  It\\r\\npains me to offend you.  But amidst your concern for the defects\\r\\nof  your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\r\\nrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider\\r\\nthat, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\\r\\nthe like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and\\r\\nyour elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and\\r\\ndisposition of both.  I will only say farther that from what passed\\r\\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\\r\\ninducement heightened which could have led me before to\\r\\npreserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\r\\nconnection.  He left Netherfield for London, on the day\\r\\nfollowing, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of\\r\\nsoon returning.\\r\\n \\r\\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained.  His sisters\\'\\r\\nuneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our\\r\\ncoincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible\\r\\nthat no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly\\r\\nresolved on joining him directly in London.  We accordingly\\r\\nwent-- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out\\r\\nto my friend the certain evils of such a choice.  I described, and\\r\\nenforced them earnestly.  But, however this remonstrance might\\r\\nhave staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\\r\\nthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not\\r\\nbeen seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of\\r\\nyour sister\\'s indifference.  He had before believed her to return\\r\\nhis affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.  But Bingley\\r\\nhas great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my\\r\\njudgement than on his own.  To convince him, therefore, that he\\r\\nhad deceived himself, was no very difficult point.  To persuade\\r\\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction\\r\\n\\r\\nhad been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.  I cannot\\r\\nblame myself for having done thus much.  There is but one part\\r\\nof my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with\\r\\nsatisfaction; it is, that I condescended to adopt the measures of\\r\\nart so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in town.  I\\r\\nknew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother\\r\\nis even yet ignorant of it.  That they might have met without ill\\r\\nconsequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear\\r\\nto me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\\r\\ndanger.  Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me;\\r\\nit is done, however, and it was done for the best.  On this subject\\r\\nI have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.  If I have\\r\\nwounded your sister\\'s feelings, it was unknowingly done and\\r\\nthough the motives which governed me may to you very\\r\\nnaturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having\\r\\ninjured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you\\r\\nthe whole of his connection with my family.  Of what he has\\r\\nPARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of\\r\\nwhat I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of\\r\\nundoubted veracity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\\r\\nmany years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and\\r\\nwhose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally\\r\\ninclined my father to be of service to him; and on George\\r\\nWickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore\\r\\nliberally bestowed.  My father supported him at school, and\\r\\nafterwards at Cambridge-- most important assistance, as his own\\r\\nfather, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would\\r\\nhave been unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education.  My\\r\\nfather was not only fond of this young man\\'s society, whose\\r\\nmanner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of\\r\\nhim, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to\\r\\nprovide for him in it.  As for myself, it is many, many years since\\r\\nI first began to think of him in a very different manner.  The\\r\\nvicious propensities-- the want of principle, which he was careful\\r\\nto guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\\r\\nthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with\\r\\nhimself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded\\r\\nmoments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.  Here again shall\\r\\ngive you pain-- to what degree you only can tell.  But whatever\\r\\nmay be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\\r\\n\\r\\nsuspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\\r\\nreal character-- it adds even another motive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his\\r\\nattachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his\\r\\nwill he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\\r\\nadvancement in the best manner that his profession might\\r\\nallow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\\r\\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant.  There was also a\\r\\nlegacy of one thousand pounds.  His own father did not long\\r\\nsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\r\\nWickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved\\r\\nagainst taking orders, he hoped I should not think it\\r\\nunreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary\\r\\nadvantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\\r\\nbenefited.  He had some intention, he added, of studying law,\\r\\nand I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be a very insufficient support therein.  I rather wished,\\r\\nthan believed him to be sincere-- but, at any rate, was perfectly\\r\\nready to accede to his proposal.  I knew that Mr. Wickham\\r\\nought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon\\r\\nsettled-- he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it\\r\\npossible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and\\r\\naccepted in return three thousand pounds.  All connection\\r\\nbetween us seemed now dissolved.  I thought too ill of him to\\r\\ninvite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.  In town I\\r\\nbelieve he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere\\r\\npretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life\\r\\nof idleness and dissipation.  For about three years I heard little of\\r\\nhim; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had\\r\\nbeen designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the\\r\\npresentation.  His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.  He had found\\r\\nthe law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\\r\\nresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living\\r\\nin question-- of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as\\r\\nhe was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\\r\\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions.\\r\\nYou will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this\\r\\nentreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it.  His resentment\\r\\nwas in proportion to the distress of his circumstances-- and he\\r\\nwas doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\\r\\nreproaches to myself.  After this period every appearance of\\r\\nacquaintance was dropped.  How he lived I know not.  But last\\r\\nsummer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to\\r\\nforget myself, and which no obligation less than the present\\r\\nshould induce me to unfold to any human being.  Having said\\r\\nthus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.  My sister, who is\\r\\nmore than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of\\r\\nmy mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.  About a\\r\\nyear ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment\\r\\nformed for her in London; and last summer she went with the\\r\\nlady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went\\r\\nMr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have\\r\\nbeen a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in\\r\\nwhose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her\\r\\nconnivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to\\r\\nGeorgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression\\r\\nof his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to\\r\\nbelieve herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.  She was\\r\\nthen but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\\r\\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it\\r\\nto herself.  I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the\\r\\nintended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\\r\\nidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost\\r\\nlooked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.  You\\r\\nmay imagine what I felt and how I acted.  Regard for my sister\\'s\\r\\ncredit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to\\r\\nMr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge\\r\\nwas of course removed from her charge.  Mr. Wickham\\'s object\\r\\nwas unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which is thirty thousand\\r\\npounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\\r\\nhimself on me was a strong inducement.  His revenge would\\r\\nhave been complete indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\\r\\nhave been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\\r\\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of\\r\\ncruelty towards Mr. Wickham.  I know not in what manner,\\r\\nunder what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his\\r\\nsuccess is not perhaps to be wondered at, ignorant as you\\r\\npreviously were of everything concerning either.  Detection\\r\\ncould not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your\\r\\ninclination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last\\r\\nnight; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what\\r\\ncould or ought to be revealed.  For the truth of everything here\\r\\n\\r\\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of\\r\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and\\r\\nconstant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my\\r\\nfather\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every\\r\\nparticular of these transactions.  If your abhorrence of ME\\r\\nshould make MY assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented\\r\\nby the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there\\r\\nmay be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to\\r\\nfind some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\\r\\ncourse of the morning.  I will only add, God bless you,\\r\\n                                   \"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 36\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect\\r\\nit to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no\\r\\nexpectation at all of its contents.  But such as they were, it may\\r\\nwell be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what\\r\\na contrariety of emotion they excited.  Her feelings as she read\\r\\nwere scarcely to be defined.  With amazement did she first\\r\\nunderstand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\\r\\nsteadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\r\\nto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.  With a\\r\\nstrong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his\\r\\naccount of what had happened at Netherfield.  She read with an\\r\\neagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and\\r\\nfrom impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring,\\r\\nwas incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her\\r\\neyes. His belief of her sister\\'s insensibility she instantly resolved\\r\\nto be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to\\r\\nthe match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him\\r\\njustice.  He expressed no regret for what he had done which\\r\\nsatisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.  It was all\\r\\npride and insolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\r\\nWickham-- when she read with somewhat clearer attention a\\r\\nrelation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished\\r\\nopinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to\\r\\nhis own history of himself-- her feelings were yet more acutely\\r\\npainful and more difficult of definition.  Astonishment,\\r\\napprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.  She wished to\\r\\ndiscredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cannot be!  This must be the grossest falsehood!\"-- and\\r\\nwhen she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely\\r\\nknowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away,\\r\\nprotesting that she would not regard it, that she would never\\r\\nlook in it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\r\\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the\\r\\nletter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she\\r\\ncould, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related\\r\\nto Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the\\r\\nmeaning of every sentence.  The account of his connection with\\r\\nthe Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself;\\r\\nand the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not\\r\\nbefore known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\\r\\nwords.  So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she\\r\\ncame to the will, the difference was great.  What Wickham had\\r\\nsaid of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled\\r\\nhis very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross\\r\\nduplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she\\r\\nflattered herself that her wishes did not err.  But when she read\\r\\nand re-read with the closest attention, the particulars\\r\\nimmediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions to\\r\\nthe living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\\r\\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.  She put\\r\\ndown the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she\\r\\nmeant to be impartiality-- deliberated on the probability of each\\r\\nstatement-- but with little success.  On both sides it was only\\r\\nassertion.  Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly\\r\\nthat the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any\\r\\ncontrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy\\'s conduct\\r\\nin it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make\\r\\nhim entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not\\r\\nto lay at Mr. Wickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the\\r\\nmore so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.  She had\\r\\nnever heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia,\\r\\nin which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man\\r\\nwho, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a\\r\\nslight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life nothing had been\\r\\nknown in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.  As to his real\\r\\ncharacter, had information been in her power, she had never felt\\r\\na wish of inquiring.  His countenance, voice, and manner had\\r\\nestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue.  She\\r\\n\\r\\ntried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\\r\\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\\r\\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue,\\r\\natone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour\\r\\nto class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of\\r\\nmany years\\' continuance.  But no such recollection befriended\\r\\nher.  She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of\\r\\nair and address; but she could remember no more substantial\\r\\ngood than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\\r\\nthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.\\r\\nAfter pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more\\r\\ncontinued to read.  But, alas! the story which followed, of his\\r\\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what\\r\\nhad passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the\\r\\nmorning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of\\r\\nevery particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself-- from whom she\\r\\nhad previously received the information of his near concern in all\\r\\nhis cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to\\r\\nquestion.  At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\\r\\nhim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the\\r\\napplication, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\\r\\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had\\r\\nnot been well assured of his cousin\\'s corroboration.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\\r\\nconversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening\\r\\nat Mr. Phillips\\'s.  Many of his expressions were still fresh in her\\r\\nmemory.  She was NOW struck with the impropriety of such\\r\\ncommunications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her\\r\\nbefore.  She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he\\r\\nhad done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his\\r\\nconduct.  She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\\r\\nof seeing Mr. Darcy-- that Mr. Darcy might leave the country,\\r\\nbut that HE should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the\\r\\nNetherfield ball the very next week.  She remembered also that,\\r\\ntill the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his\\r\\nstory to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had\\r\\nbeen everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no\\r\\nscruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\\'s character, though he had assured\\r\\nher that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing\\r\\nthe son.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was\\r\\nconcerned!  His attentions to Miss King were now the\\r\\nconsequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the\\r\\n\\r\\nmediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his\\r\\nwishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.  His behaviour to\\r\\nherself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either\\r\\nbeen deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\\r\\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she\\r\\nhad most incautiously shown.  Every lingering struggle in his\\r\\nfavour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, she could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when questioned by\\r\\nJane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that\\r\\nproud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the\\r\\nwhole course of their acquaintance-- an acquaintance which\\r\\nhad latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of\\r\\nintimacy with his ways-- seen anything that betrayed him to be\\r\\nunprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or\\r\\nimmoral habits; that among his own connections he was\\r\\nesteemed and valued-- that even Wickham had allowed him\\r\\nmerit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so\\r\\naffectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some\\r\\namiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham\\r\\nrepresented them, so gross a violation of everything right could\\r\\nhardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship\\r\\nbetween a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as\\r\\nBingley, was incomprehensible.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.  Of neither Darcy nor\\r\\nWickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,\\r\\npartial, prejudiced, absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have prided\\r\\nmyself on my discernment!  I, who have valued myself on my\\r\\nabilities!  who have often disdained the generous candour of my\\r\\nsister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\r\\nHow humiliating is this discovery!  yet, how just a humiliation!\\r\\nHad I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\r\\nBut vanity, not love, has been my folly.  Pleased with the\\r\\npreference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on\\r\\nthe very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\r\\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where\\r\\neither were concerned.  Till this moment I never knew myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n>From herself to Jane-- from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were\\r\\nin a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nexplanation THERE had appeared very insufficient, and she read\\r\\nit again.  Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\r\\nHow could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich she had been obliged to give in the other?  He declared\\r\\nhimself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister\\'s attachment; and\\r\\nshe could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s opinion had\\r\\nalways been.  Neither could she deny the justice of his\\r\\ndescription of Jane.  She felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent,\\r\\nwere little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency\\r\\nin her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\r\\nmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her\\r\\nsense of shame was severe.  The justice of the charge struck her\\r\\ntoo forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he\\r\\nparticularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and\\r\\nas confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a\\r\\nstronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.  It\\r\\nsoothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had\\r\\nthus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she\\r\\nconsidered that Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work\\r\\nof her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit\\r\\nof both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt\\r\\ndepressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to\\r\\nevery variety of thought--re-considering events, determining\\r\\nprobabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a\\r\\nchange so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection\\r\\nof her long absence, made her at length return home; and she\\r\\nentered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,\\r\\nand the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make\\r\\nher unfit for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings\\r\\nhad each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few\\r\\nminutes, to take leave-- but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been\\r\\nsitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and\\r\\nalmost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\r\\nElizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing him; she\\r\\nreally rejoiced at it.  Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an\\r\\nobject; she could think only of her letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 37\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr.\\r\\nCollins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his\\r\\nparting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing\\r\\nintelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as\\r\\ntolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene\\r\\nso lately gone through at Rosings.  To Rosings he then hastened,\\r\\nto console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\\r\\nbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her\\r\\nladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her\\r\\nvery desirous of having them all to dine with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\\r\\nhad she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to\\r\\nher as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of\\r\\nwhat her ladyship\\'s indignation would have been.  \"What would\\r\\nshe have said? how would she have behaved?\" were questions\\r\\nwith which she amused herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.  \"I\\r\\nassure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I believe\\r\\nno one feels the loss of friends so much as I do.  But I am\\r\\nparticularly attached to these young men, and know them to be\\r\\nso much attached to me!  They were excessively sorry to go!\\r\\nBut so they always are.  The dear Colonel rallied his spirits\\r\\ntolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,\\r\\nmore, I think, than last year.  His attachment to Rosings\\r\\ncertainly increases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\\r\\nwhich were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\\r\\nout of spirits. And immediately accounting for it by herself, by\\r\\nsupposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg\\r\\nthat you may stay a little longer.  Mrs. Collins will be very glad\\r\\nof your company, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\"\\r\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it.  I must\\r\\nbe in town next Saturday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.  I\\r\\nexpected you to stay two months.  I told Mrs. Collins so before\\r\\nyou came.  There can be no occasion for your going so soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But my father cannot.  He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\r\\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father.  And if\\r\\nyou will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in my power\\r\\nto take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in\\r\\nJune, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the\\r\\nbarouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--\\r\\nand indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not\\r\\nobject to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by\\r\\nour original plan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.  \"Mrs. Collins, you must send\\r\\na servant with them.  You know I always speak my mind, and I\\r\\ncannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by\\r\\nthemselves.  It is highly improper.  You must contrive to send\\r\\nsomebody.  I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of\\r\\nthing.  Young women should always be properly guarded and\\r\\nattended, according to their situation in life.  When my niece\\r\\nGeorgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\\r\\nhaving two men-servants go with her.  Miss Darcy, the daughter\\r\\nof Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have\\r\\nappeared with propriety in a different manner.  I am excessively\\r\\nattentive to all those things.  You must send John with the young\\r\\nladies, Mrs. Collins.  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it;\\r\\nfor it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go\\r\\nalone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Your uncle!  He keeps a man-servant, does he?  I am very\\r\\nglad you have somebody who thinks of these things.  Where\\r\\nshall you change horses?  Oh!  Bromley, of course.  If you\\r\\nmention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\\r\\njourney, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was\\r\\nnecessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with\\r\\n\\r\\na mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nReflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she\\r\\nwas alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day\\r\\nwent by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all\\r\\nthe delight of unpleasant recollections.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by\\r\\nheart.  She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its\\r\\nwriter were at times widely different.  When she remembered the\\r\\nstyle of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she\\r\\nconsidered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,\\r\\nher anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed\\r\\nfeelings became the object of compassion.  His attachment\\r\\nexcited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could\\r\\nnot approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\\r\\nor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.  In her\\r\\nown past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation\\r\\nand regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a constant\\r\\nsource of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her\\r\\nfamily, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.  They were hopeless of\\r\\nremedy.  Her father, contented with laughing at them, would\\r\\nnever exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest\\r\\ndaughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\\r\\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nfrequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the\\r\\nimprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were\\r\\nsupported by their mother\\'s indulgence, what chance could there\\r\\nbe of improvement?  Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and\\r\\ncompletely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always affronted\\r\\nby their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\\r\\nscarcely give them a hearing.  They were ignorant, idle, and vain.\\r\\nWhile there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him;\\r\\nand while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would\\r\\nbe going there forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former\\r\\ngood opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.  His\\r\\naffection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct\\r\\ncleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness\\r\\nof his confidence in his friend.  How grievous then was the\\r\\nthought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so\\r\\nreplete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\\r\\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\\r\\nweek of her stay as they had been at first.  The very last evening\\r\\nwas spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into\\r\\nthe particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the\\r\\nbest method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of\\r\\nplacing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself\\r\\nobliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and\\r\\npack her trunk afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\\r\\nwished them a good journey, and invited them to come to\\r\\nHunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so\\r\\nfar as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 38\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for\\r\\nbreakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took\\r\\nthe opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed\\r\\nindispensably necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs. Collins has\\r\\nyet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I\\r\\nam very certain you will not leave the house without receiving\\r\\nher thanks for it.  The favor of your company has been much\\r\\nfelt, I assure you.  We know how little there is to tempt any one\\r\\nto our humble abode.  Our plain manner of living, our small\\r\\nrooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world,\\r\\nmust make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\\r\\nyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the\\r\\ncondescension, and that we have done everything in our power\\r\\nto prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of\\r\\nhappiness.  She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and\\r\\nthe pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she\\r\\nhad received, must make HER feel the obliged.  Mr. Collins was\\r\\ngratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\r\\ntime not disagreeably.  We have certainly done our best; and\\r\\nmost fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to  very\\r\\nsuperior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the\\r\\n\\r\\nfrequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we\\r\\nmay flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been\\r\\nentirely irksome.  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\'s\\r\\nfamily is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing\\r\\nwhich few can boast.  You see on what a footing we are.  You\\r\\nsee how continually we are engaged there.  In truth I must\\r\\nacknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble\\r\\nparsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of\\r\\ncompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he\\r\\nwas obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to\\r\\nunite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\r\\nHertfordshire, my dear cousin.  I flatter myself at least that you\\r\\nwill be able to do so. Lady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs.\\r\\nCollins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it\\r\\ndoes not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate----\\r\\nBut on this point it will be as well to be silent.  Only let me\\r\\nassure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart\\r\\nmost cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.  My dear\\r\\nCharlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.\\r\\nThere is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\\r\\ncharacter and ideas between us.  We seem to have been designed\\r\\nfor each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where\\r\\nthat was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she\\r\\nfirmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was\\r\\nnot sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the\\r\\nlady from whom they sprang.  Poor Charlotte!  it was\\r\\nmelancholy to leave her to such society!  But she had chosen it\\r\\nwith her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her\\r\\nvisitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.\\r\\nHer home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and\\r\\nall their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\\r\\nparcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.  After\\r\\nan affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was\\r\\nattended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked\\r\\ndown the garden he was commissioning her with his best\\r\\nrespects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the\\r\\nkindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\\r\\n\\r\\ncompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.  He\\r\\nthen handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the\\r\\npoint of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with\\r\\nsome consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any\\r\\nmessage for the ladies at Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble\\r\\nrespects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their\\r\\nkindness to you while you have been here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be\\r\\nshut, and the carriage drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes\\' silence, \"it\\r\\nseems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many\\r\\nthings have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\\r\\ntwice!  How much I shall have to tell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth added privately, \"And how much I shall have to\\r\\nconceal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any\\r\\nalarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they\\r\\nreached Mr. Gardiner\\'s house, where they were to remain a few\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of\\r\\nstudying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the\\r\\nkindness of her aunt had reserved for them.  But Jane was to go\\r\\nhome with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough\\r\\nfor observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait\\r\\neven for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nproposals.  To know that she had the power of revealing what\\r\\nwould so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time,\\r\\nso highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet\\r\\nbeen able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as\\r\\nnothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in\\r\\nwhich she remained as to the extent of what she should\\r\\ncommunicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of\\r\\n\\r\\nbeing hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might\\r\\nonly grieve her sister further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 39\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies\\r\\nset out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in\\r\\nHertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where\\r\\nMr. Bennet\\'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived,\\r\\nin token of the coachman\\'s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia\\r\\nlooking out of a dining-room upstairs.  These two girls had been\\r\\nabove an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an\\r\\nopposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a\\r\\nsalad and cucumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table\\r\\nset out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords,\\r\\nexclaiming, \"Is not this nice?  Is not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you must\\r\\nlend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out\\r\\nthere.\"  Then, showing her purchases-- \"Look here, I have\\r\\nbought this bonnet.  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought\\r\\nI might as well buy it as not.  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I\\r\\nget home, and see if I can not make it up any better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\r\\nunconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the\\r\\nshop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to\\r\\ntrim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.  Besides, it will\\r\\nnot much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire\\r\\nhave left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so\\r\\nwant papa to take us all there for the summer!  It would be such\\r\\na delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at\\r\\nall.  Mamma would like to go too of all things!  Only think what\\r\\na miserable summer else we shall have!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"THAT would be a delightful scheme\\r\\nindeed, and completely do for us at once.  Good Heaven!\\r\\nBrighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been\\r\\n\\r\\noverset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly\\r\\nballs of Meryton!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they sat\\r\\ndown at table.  \"What do you think?  It is excellent news--\\r\\ncapital news-- and about a certain person we all like!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told\\r\\nhe need not stay.  Lydia laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.  You\\r\\nthought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!  I dare say he\\r\\noften hears worse things said than I am going to say.  But he is\\r\\nan ugly fellow!  I am glad he is gone.  I never saw such a long\\r\\nchin in my life.  Well, but now for my news; it is about dear\\r\\nWickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?  There is no danger\\r\\nof Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King.  There\\'s for you!  She is\\r\\ngone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.  Wickham is\\r\\nsafe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a\\r\\nconnection imprudent as to fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said\\r\\nJane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure there is not on HIS.  I will answer for it, he never\\r\\ncared three straws about her-- who could about such a nasty\\r\\nlittle freckled thing?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\r\\ncoarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of the\\r\\nSENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had\\r\\nharboured and fancied liberal!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\r\\nordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all\\r\\ntheir boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition\\r\\nof Kitty\\'s and Lydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia.  \"I am glad I\\r\\nbought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another\\r\\nbandbox!  Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and\\r\\n\\r\\ntalk and laugh all the way home.  And in the first place, let us\\r\\nhear what has happened to you all since you went away.  Have\\r\\nyou seen any pleasant men?  Have you had any flirting?  I was in\\r\\ngreat hopes that one of you would have got a husband before\\r\\nyou came back.  Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\r\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty!  My aunt Phillips wants you so\\r\\nto get husbands, you can\\'t think.  She says Lizzy had better have\\r\\ntaken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been\\r\\nany fun in it.  Lord! how I should like to be married before any\\r\\nof you!  and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\r\\nDear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at\\r\\nColonel Forster\\'s.  Kitty and me were to spend the day there,\\r\\nand Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening;\\r\\n(by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she\\r\\nasked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so\\r\\nPen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think\\r\\nwe did?  We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes on\\r\\npurpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!  Not a soul\\r\\nknew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me,\\r\\nexcept my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her\\r\\ngowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!  When\\r\\nDenny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the\\r\\nmen came in, they did not know him in the least.  Lord!  how I\\r\\nlaughed! and so did Mrs. Forster.  I thought I should have died.\\r\\nAnd THAT made the men suspect something, and then they\\r\\nsoon found out what was the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\r\\nLydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to\\r\\namuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlistened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the\\r\\nfrequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception at home was most kind.  Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to\\r\\nsee Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during\\r\\ndinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\\r\\nLucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various\\r\\nwere the subjects that occupied them:  Lady Lucas was inquiring\\r\\nof Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter;\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an\\r\\naccount of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way\\r\\n\\r\\nbelow her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\\r\\nLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other\\r\\nperson\\'s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning\\r\\nto anybody who would hear her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had\\r\\nsuch fun!  As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and\\r\\npretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have\\r\\ngone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got\\r\\nto the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we\\r\\ntreated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the\\r\\nworld, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you\\r\\ntoo.  And then when we came away it was such fun!  I thought\\r\\nwe never should have got into the coach.  I was ready to die of\\r\\nlaughter.  And then we were so merry all the way home!  we\\r\\ntalked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us\\r\\nten miles off!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear\\r\\nsister, to depreciate such pleasures!  They would doubtless be\\r\\ncongenial with the generality of female minds.  But I confess\\r\\nthey would have no charms for ME-- I should infinitely prefer a\\r\\nbook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word.  She seldom listened\\r\\nto anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to\\r\\nMary at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to\\r\\nwalk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but\\r\\nElizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.  It should not be said\\r\\nthat the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before\\r\\nthey were in pursuit of the officers.  There was another reason\\r\\ntoo for her opposition.  She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again,\\r\\nand was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.  The comfort to\\r\\nHER of the regiment\\'s approaching removal was indeed beyond\\r\\nexpression.  In a fortnight they were to go-- and once gone, she\\r\\nhoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the\\r\\nBrighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the\\r\\ninn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.\\r\\nElizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest\\r\\nintention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so\\r\\nvague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\\r\\n\\r\\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 40\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\\r\\ncould no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to\\r\\nsuppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and\\r\\npreparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next\\r\\nmorning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong\\r\\nsisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear\\r\\nperfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other\\r\\nfeelings.  She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his\\r\\nsentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but\\r\\nstill more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\'s\\r\\nrefusal must have given him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and\\r\\ncertainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it\\r\\nmust increase his disappointment!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he\\r\\nhas other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his\\r\\nregard for me.  You do not blame me, however, for refusing\\r\\nhim?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Blame you!  Oh, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No-- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you\\r\\ndid.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened the very\\r\\nnext day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents\\r\\nas far as they concerned George Wickham.  What a stroke was\\r\\nthis for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the\\r\\nworld without believing that so much wickedness existed in the\\r\\nwhole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.\\r\\nNor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings,\\r\\n\\r\\ncapable of consoling her for such discovery.  Most earnestly did\\r\\nshe labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the\\r\\none without involving the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to\\r\\nmake both of them good for anything.  Take your choice, but\\r\\nyou must be satisfied with only one.  There is but such a quantity\\r\\nof merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of\\r\\nman; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.  For my\\r\\npart, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\\'s; but you shall do as\\r\\nyou choose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted\\r\\nfrom Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she.\\r\\n\"Wickham so very bad!  It is almost past belief.  And poor Mr.\\r\\nDarcy!  Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\\r\\nSuch a disappointment!  and with the knowledge of your ill\\r\\nopinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister!  It is\\r\\nreally too distressing.  I am sure you must feel it so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing\\r\\nyou so full of both.  I know you will do him such ample justice,\\r\\nthat I am growing every moment more unconcerned and\\r\\nindifferent.  Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament\\r\\nover him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\r\\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the\\r\\neducation of those two young men.  One has got all the\\r\\ngoodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the APPEARANCE\\r\\nof it as you used to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided\\r\\na dislike to him, without any reason.  It is such a spur to one\\'s\\r\\ngenius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\r\\nOne may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but\\r\\none cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then\\r\\nstumbling on something witty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not\\r\\ntreat the matter as you do now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, I could not.  I was uncomfortable enough, I may say\\r\\nunhappy.  And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no\\r\\nJane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and\\r\\nvain and nonsensical as I knew I had!  Oh! how I wanted you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong\\r\\nexpressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they\\r\\nDO appear wholly undeserved.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly.  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a\\r\\nmost natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\\r\\nencouraging.  There is one point on which I want your advice.  I\\r\\nwant to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our\\r\\nacquaintances in general understand Wickham\\'s character.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can\\r\\nbe no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.  What is your\\r\\nopinion?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted.  Mr. Darcy has not\\r\\nauthorised me to make his communication public.  On the\\r\\ncontrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be\\r\\nkept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to\\r\\nundeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe\\r\\nme?  The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that\\r\\nit would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to\\r\\nattempt to place him in an amiable light.  I am not equal to it.\\r\\nWickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\\r\\nanyone here what he really is.  Some time hence it will be all\\r\\nfound out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not\\r\\nknowing it before.  At present I will say nothing about it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite right.  To have his errors made public might ruin\\r\\nhim for ever.  He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done,\\r\\nand anxious to re-establish a character.  We must not make him\\r\\ndesperate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\r\\nShe had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her\\r\\nfor a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,\\r\\nwhenever she might wish to talk again of either.  But there was\\r\\nstill something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the\\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosure.  She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nletter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been\\r\\nvalued by her friend.  Here was knowledge in which no one\\r\\ncould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a\\r\\nperfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\\r\\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery.  \"And then,\" said\\r\\nshe, \"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall\\r\\nmerely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more\\r\\nagreeable manner himself.  The liberty of communication cannot\\r\\nbe mine till it has lost all its value!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\\r\\nreal state of her sister\\'s spirits.  Jane was not happy.  She still\\r\\ncherished a very tender affection for Bingley.  Having never even\\r\\nfancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of\\r\\nfirst attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater\\r\\nsteadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so\\r\\nfervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every\\r\\nother man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\r\\nfeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of\\r\\nthose regrets which must have been injurious to her own health\\r\\nand their tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion\\r\\nNOW of this sad business of Jane\\'s?  For my part, I am\\r\\ndetermined never to speak of it again to anybody.  I told my\\r\\nsister Phillips so the other day.  But I cannot find out that Jane\\r\\nsaw anything of him in London.  Well, he is a very undeserving\\r\\nyoung man-- and I do not suppose there\\'s the least chance in the\\r\\nworld of her ever getting him now.  There is no talk of his\\r\\ncoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired\\r\\nof everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses.  Nobody wants him to come.\\r\\nThough I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and\\r\\nif I was her, I would not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort\\r\\nis, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be\\r\\nsorry for what he has done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\\r\\nexpectation, she made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so\\r\\n\\r\\nthe Collinses live very comfortable, do they?  Well, well, I only\\r\\nhope it will last.  And what sort of table do they keep?  Charlotte\\r\\nis an excellent manager, I dare say.  If she is half as sharp as her\\r\\nmother, she is saving enough.  There is nothing extravagant in\\r\\nTHEIR housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.  Yes, yes.\\r\\nTHEY will take care not to outrun their income.  THEY will\\r\\nnever be distressed for money.  Well, much good may it do\\r\\nthem!  And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn\\r\\nwhen your father is dead.  They look upon it as quite their own,\\r\\nI dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no\\r\\ndoubt they often talk of it between themselves.  Well, if they can\\r\\nbe easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the\\r\\nbetter.  I should be ashamed of having one that was only\\r\\nentailed on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 41\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.\\r\\nIt was the last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the\\r\\nyoung ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.  The\\r\\ndejection was almost universal.  The elder Miss Bennets alone\\r\\nwere still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual\\r\\ncourse of their employments.  Very frequently were they\\r\\nreproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own\\r\\nmisery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\\r\\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us?  What are we to do?\"\\r\\nwould they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe.  \"How can\\r\\nyou be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\\r\\nwhat she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty\\r\\nyears ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when\\r\\nColonel Miller\\'s regiment went away.  I thought I should have\\r\\nbroken my heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I shall break MINE,\" said Lydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!-- if one could but go to Brighton!  But papa is so\\r\\ndisagreeable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal of\\r\\ngood,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually\\r\\nthrough Longbourn House.  Elizabeth tried to be diverted by\\r\\nthem; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.  She felt anew\\r\\nthe justice of Mr. Darcy\\'s objections; and never had she been so\\r\\nmuch disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\\r\\nshe received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the\\r\\ncolonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.  This\\r\\ninvaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately\\r\\nmarried.  A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had\\r\\nrecommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their\\r\\nTHREE months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate TWO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\r\\nForster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of\\r\\nKitty, are scarcely to be described.  Wholly inattentive to her\\r\\nsister\\'s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy,\\r\\ncalling for every one\\'s congratulations, and laughing and talking\\r\\nwith more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued\\r\\nin the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her\\r\\naccent was peevish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well as\\r\\nLydia,\" said she, \"Though I am NOT her particular friend.  I\\r\\nhave just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for\\r\\nI am two years older.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane\\r\\nto make her resigned.  As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation\\r\\nwas so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother\\r\\nand Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all\\r\\npossibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such\\r\\na step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly\\r\\nadvising her father not to let her go.  She represented to him all\\r\\nthe improprieties of Lydia\\'s general behaviour, the little\\r\\nadvantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman\\r\\nas Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\r\\nimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the\\r\\ntemptations must be greater than at home.  He heard her\\r\\nattentively, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\\r\\npublic place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with\\r\\nso little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the\\r\\npresent circumstances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great\\r\\ndisadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of\\r\\nLydia\\'s unguarded and imprudent manner-- nay, which has\\r\\nalready arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in\\r\\nthe affair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet.  \"What, has she\\r\\nfrightened away some of your lovers?  Poor little Lizzy!  But do\\r\\nnot be cast down.  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be\\r\\nconnected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.  Come,\\r\\nlet me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by\\r\\nLydia\\'s folly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken.  I have no such injuries to resent.  It is\\r\\nnot of particular, but of general evils, which I am now\\r\\ncomplaining.  Our importance, our respectability in the world\\r\\nmust be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain\\r\\nof all restraint which mark Lydia\\'s character.  Excuse me, for I\\r\\nmust speak plainly.  If you, my dear father, will not take the\\r\\ntrouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her\\r\\nthat her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she\\r\\nwill soon be beyond the reach of amendment.  Her character will\\r\\nbe fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\r\\nthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\\r\\nworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction\\r\\nbeyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance\\r\\n\\r\\nand emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any\\r\\nportion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration\\r\\nwill excite.  In this danger Kitty also is comprehended.  She will\\r\\nfollow wherever Lydia leads.  Vain, ignorant, idle, and\\r\\nabsolutely uncontrolled!  Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it\\r\\npossible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\\r\\nthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved\\r\\nin the disgrace?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\r\\naffectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane\\r\\nare known you must be respected and valued; and you will not\\r\\nappear to less advantage for having a couple of-- or I may say,\\r\\nthree-- very silly sisters.  We shall have no peace at Longbourn if\\r\\nLydia does not go to Brighton.  Let her go, then.  Colonel\\r\\nForster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real\\r\\nmischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to\\r\\nanybody.  At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a\\r\\ncommon flirt than she has been here.  The officers will find\\r\\nwomen better worth their notice.  Let us hope, therefore, that\\r\\nher being there may teach her her own insignificance.  At any\\r\\nrate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising\\r\\nus to lock her up for the rest of her life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her\\r\\nown opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed\\r\\nand sorry.  It was not in her nature, however, to increase her\\r\\nvexations by dwelling on them.  She was confident of having\\r\\nperformed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or\\r\\naugment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her\\r\\nconference with her father, their indignation would hardly have\\r\\nfound expression in their united volubility.  In Lydia\\'s\\r\\nimagination, a visit to Brighton comprised ever possibility of\\r\\nearthly happiness.  She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the\\r\\nstreets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.  She saw\\r\\nherself  the object to tens and to scores of them at present\\r\\nunknown.  She saw all the glories of the camp-- its tents\\r\\nstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with\\r\\nthe young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to\\r\\ncomplete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent,\\r\\ntenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\\r\\nand such realities as these, what would have been her\\r\\nsensations?  They could have been understood only by her\\r\\nmother, who might have felt nearly the same.  Lydia\\'s going to\\r\\nBrighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction\\r\\nof her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their\\r\\nraptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of\\r\\nLydia\\'s leaving home.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.\\r\\nHaving been frequently in company with him since her return,\\r\\nagitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality\\r\\nentirely so.  She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness\\r\\nwhich had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to\\r\\ndisgust and weary.  In his present behaviour to herself,\\r\\nmoreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the\\r\\ninclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\r\\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,\\r\\nafter what had since passed, to provoke her.  She lost all concern\\r\\nfor him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle\\r\\nand frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could\\r\\nnot but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however\\r\\nlong, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn,\\r\\nher vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any\\r\\ntime by their renewal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining at Meryton, he\\r\\ndined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was\\r\\nElizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his\\r\\nmaking some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had\\r\\npassed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and\\r\\nasked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked surprised displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s\\r\\nrecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly\\r\\nseen him often; and, after observing that he was a very\\r\\ngentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.  Her\\r\\nanswer was warmly in his favour.  With an air of indifference he\\r\\nsoon afterwards added:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very different.  But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\\r\\nacquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape\\r\\nher.  \"And pray, may I ask?-- \"  But checking himself, he added,\\r\\nin a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves?  Has he\\r\\ndeigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?-- for I dare\\r\\nnot hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone, \"that\\r\\nhe is improved in essentials.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth.  \"In essentials, I believe, he is very\\r\\nmuch what he ever was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing\\r\\nwhether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.\\r\\nThere was a something in her countenance which made him\\r\\nlisten with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she\\r\\nadded:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\\r\\nthat his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but\\r\\nthat, from knowing him better, his disposition was better\\r\\nunderstood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\\r\\nagitated look; for a few minuted he was silent, till, shaking off\\r\\nhis embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the\\r\\ngentlest of accents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will\\r\\nreadily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise\\r\\nenough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is right.\\r\\nHis pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself,\\r\\nto many others, for it must only deter him from such foul\\r\\nmisconduct as I have suffered by.  I only fear that the sort of\\r\\ncautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\\r\\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion\\r\\n\\r\\nand judgement he stands much in awe.  His fear of her has\\r\\nalways operated, I know, when they were together; and a good\\r\\ndeal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with\\r\\nMiss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only\\r\\nby a slight inclination of the head.  She saw that he wanted to\\r\\nengage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in\\r\\nno humour to indulge him.  The rest of the evening passed with\\r\\nthe APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with\\r\\nno further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at\\r\\nlast with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never\\r\\nmeeting again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\\r\\nMeryton, from whence they were to set out early the next\\r\\nmorning.  The separation between her and her family was rather\\r\\nnoisy than pathetic.  Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but\\r\\nshe did weep from vexation and envy.  Mrs. Bennet was diffuse\\r\\nin her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and\\r\\nimpressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\\r\\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible-- advice\\r\\nwhich there was every reason to believe would be well attended\\r\\nto; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding\\r\\nfarewell, the more gentle adieux of her sisters were uttered\\r\\nwithout being heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 42\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Elizabeth\\'s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\\r\\ncould not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal\\r\\nfelicity or domestic comfort.  Her father, captivated by youth\\r\\nand beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth\\r\\nand beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak\\r\\nunderstanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage\\r\\nput and end to all real affection for her.  Respect, esteem, and\\r\\nconfidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic\\r\\nhappiness were overthrown.  But Mr. Bennet was not of a\\r\\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his\\r\\nown imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which\\r\\ntoo often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice.  He\\r\\nwas fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had\\r\\narisen his principal enjoyments.  To his wife he was very little\\r\\n\\r\\notherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had\\r\\ncontributed to his amusement.  This is not the sort of happiness\\r\\nwhich a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but\\r\\nwhere other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\\r\\nphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of\\r\\nher father\\'s behaviour as a husband.  She had always seen it with\\r\\npain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate\\r\\ntreatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could\\r\\nnot overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual\\r\\nbreach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing\\r\\nhis wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly\\r\\nreprehensible.  But she had never felt so strongly as now the\\r\\ndisadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a\\r\\nmarriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from\\r\\nso ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\\r\\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,\\r\\neven if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure she\\r\\nfound little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the\\r\\nregiment.  Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and\\r\\nat home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at\\r\\nthe dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over\\r\\ntheir domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her\\r\\nnatural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were\\r\\nremoved, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil\\r\\nmight be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly\\r\\nand assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\r\\nwatering-place and a camp.  Upon the whole, therefore, she\\r\\nfound, what has been sometimes been found before, that an\\r\\nevent to which she had been looking with impatient desire did\\r\\nnot, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised\\r\\nherself.  It was consequently necessary to name some other\\r\\nperiod for the commencement of actual felicity-- to have some\\r\\nother point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and\\r\\nby again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for\\r\\nthe present, and prepare for another disappointment.  Her tour\\r\\nto the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was\\r\\nher best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the\\r\\ndiscontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and\\r\\ncould she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it\\r\\nwould have been perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to wish\\r\\nfor.  Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment\\r\\nwould be certain.  But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless\\r\\nsource of regret in my sister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to\\r\\nhave all my expectations of pleasure realised.  A scheme of\\r\\nwhich every part promises delight can never be successful; and\\r\\ngeneral disappointment is only warded off by the defence of\\r\\nsome little peculiar vexation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and\\r\\nvery minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were\\r\\nalways long expected, and always very short.  Those to her\\r\\nmother contained little else than that they were just returned\\r\\nfrom the library, where such and such officers had attended\\r\\nthem, and where she had seen such beautiful  ornaments as made\\r\\nher quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\\r\\nshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave\\r\\noff in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were\\r\\ngoing off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her\\r\\nsister,  there was still less to be learnt-- for her letters to Kitty,\\r\\nthough rather longer, were much too full of lines under the\\r\\nwords to be made public.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\r\\ngood humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\r\\nEverything wore a happier aspect.  The families who had been in\\r\\ntown for the winter came back again, and summer finery and\\r\\nsummer engagements arose.  Mrs. Bennet was restored to her\\r\\nusual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was\\r\\nso much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears;\\r\\nan event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that\\r\\nby the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable\\r\\nas not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some\\r\\ncruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another\\r\\nregiment should be quartered in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\\r\\nfast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a\\r\\nletter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its\\r\\ncommencement and curtailed its extent.  Mr. Gardiner would be\\r\\nprevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in\\r\\nJuly, and must be in London again within a month, and as that\\r\\nleft too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much\\r\\nas they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and\\r\\ncomfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the\\r\\n\\r\\nLakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to\\r\\nthe present plan, were to go no farther northwards than\\r\\nDerbyshire.  In that county there was enough to be seen to\\r\\noccupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it\\r\\nhad a peculiarly strong attraction.  The town where she had\\r\\nformerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now\\r\\nto spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her\\r\\ncuriosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\\r\\nDovedale, or the Peak.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\\r\\nseeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time\\r\\nenough.  But it was her business to be satisfied-- and certainly\\r\\nher temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas\\r\\nconnected.  It was impossible for her to see the word without\\r\\nthinking of Pemberley and its owner.  \"But surely,\" said she, \"I\\r\\nmay enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few\\r\\npetrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled.  Four weeks were\\r\\nto pass away before her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival.  But they did\\r\\npass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children,\\r\\ndid at length appear at Longbourn.  The children, two girls of six\\r\\nand eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under\\r\\nthe particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general\\r\\nfavourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper\\r\\nexactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--\\r\\nteaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off\\r\\nthe next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and\\r\\namusement.  One enjoyment was certain-- that of suitableness of\\r\\ncompanions; a suitableness which comprehended health and\\r\\ntemper to bear inconveniences-- cheerfulness to enhance every\\r\\npleasure-- and affection and intelligence, which might supply it\\r\\namong themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of\\r\\nDerbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which\\r\\ntheir route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,\\r\\nBirmingham, &c., are sufficiently known.  A small part of\\r\\nDerbyshire is all the present concern.  To the little town of\\r\\nLambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\\'s former residence, and\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained,\\r\\nthey bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders\\r\\nof the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth\\r\\nfound from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.  It was not in\\r\\ntheir direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.  In\\r\\ntalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner\\r\\nexpressed an inclination to see the place again.  Mr. Gardiner\\r\\ndeclared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her\\r\\napprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\\r\\nheard so much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so\\r\\nmany of your acquaintances are connected.  Wickham passed all\\r\\nhis youth there, you know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was distressed.  She felt that she had no business at\\r\\nPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\\r\\nit.  She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\\r\\ngoing over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\\r\\nsatin curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.  If it were merely a fine\\r\\nhouse richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it\\r\\nmyself; but the grounds are delightful.  They have some of the\\r\\nfinest woods in the country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said no more-- but her mind could not acquiesce.  The\\r\\npossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\\r\\ninstantly occurred.  It would be dreadful!  She blushed at the\\r\\nvery idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her\\r\\naunt than to run such a risk.  But against this there were\\r\\nobjections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last\\r\\nresource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family\\r\\nwere unfavourably answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the\\r\\nchambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\\r\\nwhat was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm,\\r\\nwhether the family were down for the summer?  A most\\r\\nwelcome negative followed the last question-- and her alarms\\r\\nnow being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\\r\\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was\\r\\nrevived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could\\r\\nreadily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had\\r\\nnot really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore,\\r\\nthey were to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 43\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\\r\\nof Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at\\r\\nlength they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high\\r\\nflutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\r\\nThey entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\\r\\ntime through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\\r\\nadmired every remarkable spot and point of view.  They\\r\\ngradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves\\r\\nat the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,\\r\\nand the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated\\r\\non the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some\\r\\nabruptness wound.  It was a large, handsome stone building,\\r\\nstanding well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\\r\\nwoody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance\\r\\nwas swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.\\r\\nIts banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwas delighted.  She had never seen a place for which nature had\\r\\ndone more, or where natural beauty had been so little\\r\\ncounteracted by an awkward taste.  They were all of them warm\\r\\nin their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be\\r\\nmistress of Pemberley might be something!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\\r\\ndoor; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all\\r\\nher apprehension of meeting its owner returned.  She dreaded\\r\\nlest the chambermaid had been mistaken.  On applying to see\\r\\nthe place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as\\r\\nthey waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her\\r\\nbeing where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman,\\r\\nmuch less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of\\r\\nfinding her.  They followed her into the dining-parlour.  It was\\r\\na large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.\\r\\nElizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy\\r\\nits prospect.  The hill, crowned with wood, which they had\\r\\ndescended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\\r\\nwas a beautiful object.  Every disposition of the ground was\\r\\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees\\r\\nscattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as\\r\\nshe could trace it, with delight.  As they passed into other\\r\\nrooms these objects were taking different positions; but from\\r\\nevery window there were beauties to be seen.  The rooms were\\r\\nlofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune\\r\\nof its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste,\\r\\nthat it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\\r\\nsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress!\\r\\nWith these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\r\\nInstead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in\\r\\nthem as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle\\r\\nand aunt.  But no,\" recollecting herself-- \"that could never be;\\r\\nmy uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not\\r\\nhave been allowed to invite them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a lucky recollection-- it saved her from something\\r\\nvery like regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master\\r\\nwas really absent, but had not the courage for it.  At length\\r\\nhowever, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned\\r\\naway with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was,\\r\\nadding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of\\r\\nfriends.\"  How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey\\r\\nhad not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture.  She approached\\r\\nand saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst\\r\\nseveral other miniatures, over the mantelpiece.  Her aunt asked\\r\\nher, smilingly, how she liked it.  The housekeeper came forward,\\r\\nand told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of\\r\\nher late master\\'s steward, who had been brought up by him at\\r\\nhis own expense.  \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\\r\\n\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth\\r\\ncould not return it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\\r\\nminiatures, \"is my master-- and very like him.  It was drawn at\\r\\nthe same time as the other-- about eight years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face.  But,\\r\\nLizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\r\\nintimation of her knowing her master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery\\r\\nupstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\r\\nThis room was my late master\\'s favourite room, and these\\r\\nminiatures are just as they used to be then.  He was very fond\\r\\nof them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\\'s being among\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss\\r\\nDarcy, drawn when she was only eight\\r\\nyears old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! yes-- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and\\r\\nso accomplished!-- She plays and sings all day long.  In the next\\r\\nroom is a new instrument just come down for her-- a present\\r\\nfrom my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,\\r\\nencouraged her communicativeness by his questions and\\r\\nremarks:  Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had\\r\\nevidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend\\r\\nhalf his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the\\r\\nsummer months.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be.  I do not\\r\\nknow who is good enough for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.  Elizabeth could not help saying,\\r\\n\"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think\\r\\nso.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that\\r\\nknows him,\" replied the other.  Elizabeth thought this was\\r\\ngoing pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment\\r\\nas the housekeeper added, \"I have never known a cross word\\r\\nfrom him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was\\r\\nfour years old.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\\r\\nto her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been\\r\\nher firmest opinion.  Her keenest attention was awakened; she\\r\\nlonged to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.  You\\r\\nare lucky in having such a master.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am.  If I were to go through the world, I\\r\\ncould not meet with a better.  But I have always observed, that\\r\\nthey who are good-natured when children, are good-natured\\r\\nwhen they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered,\\r\\nmost generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth almost stared at her.  \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\"\\r\\nthought she.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like\\r\\nhim-- just as affable to the poor.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\\r\\nmore.  Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She\\r\\nrelated the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms,\\r\\nand the price of the furniture, in vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly\\r\\namused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed\\r\\nher excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to\\r\\nthe subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as\\r\\nthey proceeded together up the great staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that\\r\\never lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of\\r\\nnothing but themselves.  There is not one of his tenants or\\r\\nservants but will give him a good name.  Some people call him\\r\\nproud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.  To my fancy, it\\r\\nis only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought\\r\\nElizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked,\\r\\n\"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a\\r\\nvery pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance\\r\\nand lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that\\r\\nit was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had\\r\\ntaken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked\\r\\ntowards one of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she\\r\\nshould enter the room.  \"And this is always the way with him,\"\\r\\nshe added.  \"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to\\r\\nbe done in a moment.  There is nothing he would not do for\\r\\nher.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\\r\\nwere all that remained to be shown.  In the former were many\\r\\ngood paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from\\r\\nsuch as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned\\r\\nto look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\'s, in crayons, whose\\r\\nsubjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could\\r\\nhave little to fix the attention of a stranger.  Elizabeth walked in\\r\\nquest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\r\\nAt last it arrested her-- and she beheld a striking resemblance to\\r\\nMr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered\\r\\nto have sometimes seen when he looked at her.  She stood\\r\\nseveral minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation,\\r\\nand returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.  Mrs.\\r\\nReynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\\'s\\r\\nlifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more\\r\\ngentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\\r\\nthe height of their acquaintance.  The commendation bestowed\\r\\non him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise\\r\\nis more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?  As a\\r\\nbrother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\'s\\r\\nhappiness were in his guardianship!-- how much of pleasure or\\r\\npain was it in his power to bestow!-- how much of good or evil\\r\\nmust be done by him!  Every idea that had been brought forward\\r\\nby the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\\r\\nstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed\\r\\nhis eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper\\r\\nsentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she\\r\\nremembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of\\r\\nexpression.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had\\r\\nbeen seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\\r\\nhousekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met\\r\\nthem at the hall-door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\\r\\nturned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\\r\\nwhile the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\\r\\nthe owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\\r\\nwhich led behind it to the stables.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\\r\\nhis appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.  Their\\r\\neyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\\r\\nthe deepest blush.  He absolutely started, and for a moment\\r\\nseemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself,\\r\\nadvanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in\\r\\nterms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\r\\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to\\r\\nbe overcome.  Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to\\r\\nthe picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to\\r\\nassure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the\\r\\ngardener\\'s expression of surprise, on beholding his master,\\r\\nmust immediately have told it.  They stood a little aloof while\\r\\nhe was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\\r\\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what\\r\\nanswer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.\\r\\nAmazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted,\\r\\nevery sentence that he uttered was increasing her\\r\\nembarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her\\r\\nbeing found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in\\r\\nwhich they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\\r\\nher life.  Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke,\\r\\nhis accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\\r\\ninquiries as to the time of  her having left Longbourn, and of her\\r\\nhaving stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way,\\r\\nas plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\\r\\nfew moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\\r\\nhimself, and took leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\\r\\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed\\r\\nby her own feelings, followed them in silence.  She was\\r\\noverpowered by shame and vexation.  Her coming there was\\r\\nthe most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!\\r\\nHow strange it must appear to him!  In what a disgraceful light\\r\\nmight it not strike so vain a man!  It might seem as if she had\\r\\npurposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she\\r\\ncome?  Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?\\r\\nHad they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been\\r\\nbeyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he\\r\\nwas that moment arrived-- that moment alighted from his horse\\r\\nor his carriage.  She blushed again and again over the\\r\\nperverseness of the meeting.  And his behaviour, so strikingly\\r\\naltered-- what could it mean?  That he should even speak to her\\r\\nwas amazing!-- but to speak with such civility, to inquire after\\r\\nher family!  Never in her life had she seen his manners so little\\r\\ndignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this\\r\\nunexpected meeting.  What a contrast did it offer to his last\\r\\naddress in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!\\r\\nShe  knew not what to think, or how to account for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\\r\\nand every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or\\r\\na finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but\\r\\nit was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\\r\\nthough she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of\\r\\nher uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such\\r\\nobjects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the\\r\\nscene.  Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of\\r\\nPemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\\r\\nwas.  She longed to know what at the moment was passing in\\r\\nhis mind-- in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in\\r\\ndefiance of everything, she was still dear to him.  Perhaps he\\r\\nhad been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had\\r\\nbeen THAT in his voice which was not like ease.  Whether he\\r\\nhad felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not\\r\\ntell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her\\r\\nabsence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of\\r\\nappearing more like herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\\r\\nwhile, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots\\r\\nwhere the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander,\\r\\nwere many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,\\r\\nwith the long range of woods overspreading many, and\\r\\noccasionally part of the stream.  Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\\r\\nof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a\\r\\nwalk.  With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten\\r\\nmiles round.  It settled the matter; and they pursued the\\r\\naccustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time,\\r\\nin a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water,\\r\\nand one of its narrowest parts.  They crossed it by a simple\\r\\nbridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a\\r\\nspot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley,\\r\\nhere contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\\r\\nand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which\\r\\nbordered it.  Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when\\r\\nthey had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from\\r\\nthe house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go\\r\\nno farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as\\r\\nquickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit,\\r\\nand they took their way towards the house on the opposite side\\r\\nof the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was\\r\\nslow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste,\\r\\nwas very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching\\r\\nthe occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and\\r\\ntalking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.\\r\\nWhilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again\\r\\nsurprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment was quite equal to what\\r\\nit had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them,\\r\\nand at no great distance.  The walk here being here less\\r\\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\r\\nthey met.  Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\\r\\nprepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear\\r\\nand to speak with calmness, if we really intended to meet them.\\r\\nFor a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably\\r\\nstrike into some other path.  The idea lasted while a turning in\\r\\nthe walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he\\r\\nwas immediately before them.  With a glance, she saw that he\\r\\nhad lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\\r\\npoliteness, she began as they to admire the beauty of the place;\\r\\nbut she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and\\r\\n\"charming,\" when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she\\r\\nfancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be\\r\\nmischievously construed.  Her colour changed, and she said no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\\r\\nhe asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him\\r\\nto her friends.  This was a stroke of civility for which she was\\r\\nquite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\\r\\nbeing now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very\\r\\npeople against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to\\r\\nherself.  \"What will be his surprise,\" thought she, \"when he\\r\\nknows who they are?  He takes them now for people of\\r\\nfashion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she\\r\\nnamed their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him,\\r\\nto see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of\\r\\nhis decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful\\r\\ncompanions.  That he was SURPRISED by the connection was\\r\\nevident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from\\r\\ngoing away, turned his back with them, and entered into\\r\\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner.  Elizabeth could not but be\\r\\npleased, could not but triumph.  It was consoling that he should\\r\\nknow she had some relations for whom there was no need to\\r\\nblush.  She listened most attentively to all that passed between\\r\\nthem, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her\\r\\nuncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good\\r\\nmanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\r\\nDarcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often\\r\\nas he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering\\r\\nat the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing\\r\\nout those parts of the stream where there was usually most\\r\\nsport.  Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\\r\\nElizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.  Elizabeth\\r\\nsaid nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\\r\\nmust be all for herself.  Her astonishment, however, was\\r\\nextreme, and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so\\r\\naltered?  From what can it proceed?  It cannot be for ME-- it\\r\\ncannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus softened.  My\\r\\nreproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.  It\\r\\nis impossible that he should still love me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after\\r\\ndescending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of\\r\\nsome curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.\\r\\nIt originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of\\r\\nthe morning, found Elizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support,\\r\\nand consequently preferred her husband\\'s.  Mr. Darcy took her\\r\\nplace by her niece, and they walked on together.  After a short\\r\\nsilence, the lady first spoke.  She wished him to know that she\\r\\nhad been assured of his absence before she came to the place,\\r\\nand accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\\r\\nvery unexpected-- \"for your housekeeper,\" she added,\\r\\n\"informed us that you would certainly not be here till\\r\\nto-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we\\r\\nunderstood that you were not immediately expected in the\\r\\ncountry.\"  He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\\r\\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a\\r\\nfew hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been\\r\\ntravelling.  \"They will join me early to-morrow ,\" he continued,\\r\\n\"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with\\r\\nyou-- Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow.  Her thoughts were\\r\\ninstantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\\'s name had\\r\\nbeen the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge\\r\\nby his complexion, HIS mind was not very differently engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after\\r\\na pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you.\\r\\nWill you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister\\r\\nto your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\\r\\ngreat for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.  She\\r\\nimmediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\\r\\nbeing acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\\r\\nwithout looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to\\r\\nknow that is resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\r\\nElizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\\r\\nflattered and pleased.  His wish of introducing his sister to her\\r\\nwas a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\\r\\nothers, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house-- but she declared\\r\\nherself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.  At such\\r\\na time much might have been said, and silence was very\\r\\nawkward.  She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an\\r\\nembargo on every subject.  At last she recollected that she had\\r\\nbeen travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\\r\\ngreat perseverance.  Yet time and her aunt moved slowly-- and\\r\\nher patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the\\r\\ntete-a-tete was over.  On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s coming up\\r\\nthey were all pressed to go into the house and take some\\r\\nrefreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each\\r\\nside with utmost politeness.  Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into\\r\\nthe carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking\\r\\nslowly towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\\r\\nthem pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\\r\\nhad expected.  \"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\\r\\nunassuming,\" said her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\\r\\naunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.  I can\\r\\nnow say with the housekeeper, that though some people may\\r\\ncall him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.  It was\\r\\nmore than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity\\r\\nfor such attention.  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very\\r\\ntrifling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as\\r\\nWickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for\\r\\nhis features are perfectly good.  But how came you to tell me\\r\\nthat he was so disagreeable?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\\r\\nliked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\\r\\nshe had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\"\\r\\nreplied her uncle.  \"Your great men often are; and therefore I\\r\\nshall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\\r\\nanother day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character,\\r\\nbut said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I\\r\\nreally should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\\r\\ncruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.  He\\r\\nhas not an ill-natured look.  On the contrary, there is something\\r\\npleasing about his mouth when he speaks.  And there is\\r\\nsomething of dignity in his countenance that would not give one\\r\\nan unfavourable idea of his heart.  But, to be sure, the good lady\\r\\nwho showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\r\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.  But he is a liberal\\r\\nmaster, I suppose, and THAT in the eye of a servant\\r\\ncomprehends every virtue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\\r\\nvindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave\\r\\nthem to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that\\r\\nby what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions\\r\\nwere capable of a very different construction; and that his\\r\\ncharacter was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\'s so amiable,\\r\\nas they had been considered in Hertfordshire.  In confirmation\\r\\nof this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\\r\\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually\\r\\nnaming her authority, but stating as such as might be relied on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were\\r\\nnow approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea\\r\\ngave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much\\r\\nengaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots\\r\\nin its environs to think of anything else.  Fatigued as she had\\r\\nbeen by the morning\\'s walk they had no sooner dined than she\\r\\nset off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the\\r\\nevening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed\\r\\nafter many years\\' discontinuance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave\\r\\nElizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she\\r\\ncould do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy\\'s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be\\r\\nacquainted with his sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 44\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to\\r\\nvisit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was\\r\\nconsequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole\\r\\nof that morning.  But her conclusion was false; for on the very\\r\\nmorning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.\\r\\nThey had been walking about the place with some of their new\\r\\nfriends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves\\r\\nfor dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage\\r\\ndrew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady\\r\\nin a curricle driving up the street.  Elizabeth immediately\\r\\nrecognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no\\r\\nsmall degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them\\r\\nwith the honour which she expected.  Her uncle and aunt were\\r\\nall amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she\\r\\nspoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the\\r\\ncircumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea\\r\\non the business.  Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they\\r\\nfelt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions\\r\\nfrom such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.\\r\\nWhile these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the\\r\\nperturbation of Elizabeth\\'s feelings was at every moment\\r\\nincreasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but\\r\\namongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality\\r\\nof the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more\\r\\nthan commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that\\r\\nevery power of pleasing would fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\\r\\nwalked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose\\r\\nherself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and\\r\\naunt as made everything worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\\r\\nintroduction took place.  With astonishment did Elizabeth see\\r\\nthat her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as\\r\\nherself.  Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss\\r\\nDarcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few\\r\\nminutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.  She\\r\\nfound it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a\\r\\nmonosyllable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\\r\\nthough little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\\r\\nappearance womanly and graceful.  She was less handsome than\\r\\nher brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face,\\r\\nand her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.\\r\\nElizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and\\r\\nunembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was\\r\\nmuch relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\\r\\nBingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\\r\\nto express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\\r\\nBingley\\'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\\r\\nentered the room.  All Elizabeth\\'s anger against him had been\\r\\nlong done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have\\r\\nstood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\\r\\nexpressed himself on seeing her again.  He inquired in a friendly,\\r\\nthough general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\\r\\nthe same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\\r\\npersonage than to herself.  They had long wished to see him.\\r\\nThe whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.\\r\\nThe suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their\\r\\nniece directed their observation towards each with an earnest\\r\\nthough guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those\\r\\ninquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\\r\\nit was to love.  Of the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little in\\r\\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration\\r\\nwas evident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do.  She wanted to\\r\\nascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to\\r\\ncompose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in\\r\\nthe latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most\\r\\nsure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give\\r\\npleasure were prepossessed in her favour.  Bingley was ready,\\r\\nGeorgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and,\\r\\noh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were\\r\\ndirected in a like manner.  Sometimes she could fancy that he\\r\\ntalked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\\r\\nherself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to\\r\\ntrace a resemblance .  But, though this might be imaginary, she\\r\\ncould not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who\\r\\nhad been set up as a rival to Jane.  No look appeared on either\\r\\nside that spoke particular regard.  Nothing occurred between\\r\\nthem that could justify the hopes of his sister.  On this point she\\r\\nwas soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances\\r\\noccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation,\\r\\ndenoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness,\\r\\nand a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her,\\r\\nhad he dared.  He observed to her, at a moment when the others\\r\\nwere talking together, and in a tone which had something of real\\r\\nregret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had the\\r\\npleasure of seeing her\"; and, before she could reply, he added,\\r\\n\"It is above eight months.  We have not met since the 26th of\\r\\nNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\\r\\nafterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by\\r\\nany of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn.\\r\\nThere was not much in the question, nor in the preceding\\r\\nremark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhimself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\\r\\nexpression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\\r\\nheard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his\\r\\ncompanions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners\\r\\nwhich she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its\\r\\nexistence might prove, had at least outlived one day.  When she\\r\\nsaw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good\\r\\nopinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago\\r\\nwould have been a disgrace-- when she saw him thus civil, not\\r\\nonly to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly\\r\\ndisdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford\\r\\nParsonage-- the difference, the change was so great, and struck\\r\\nso forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her\\r\\nastonishment from being visible.  Never, even in the company of\\r\\nhis dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\\r\\nRosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\\r\\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no\\r\\nimportance could result from the success of his endeavours, and\\r\\nwhen even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions\\r\\nwere addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of\\r\\nthe ladies both of Netherfield as Rosings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when\\r\\nthey arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him\\r\\nin expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and\\r\\nMiss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the\\r\\ncountry.  Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked\\r\\nher little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.  Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how SHE,\\r\\nwhom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\\r\\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.  Presuming\\r\\nhowever, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary\\r\\nembarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her\\r\\nhusband, who was fond or society, a perfect willingness to\\r\\naccept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the\\r\\nday after the next was fixed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\\r\\nElizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many\\r\\ninquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.  Elizabeth,\\r\\nconstruing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister,\\r\\nwas pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found\\r\\nherself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the\\r\\nlast half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was\\r\\npassing, the enjoyment of it had been little.  Eager to be alone,\\r\\nand fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she\\r\\nstayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable\\r\\nopinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\\'s curiosity;\\r\\nit was not their wish to force her communication.  It was evident\\r\\nthat she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they\\r\\nhad before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in\\r\\nlove with her.  They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify\\r\\ninquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,\\r\\nas far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\r\\nThey could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they\\r\\ndrawn his character from their own feelings and his servant\\'s\\r\\nreport, without any reference to any other account, the circle in\\r\\nHertfordshire to which he was known would not have\\r\\nrecognized it for Mr. Darcy.  There was now an interest,\\r\\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became\\r\\nsensible that the authority of a servant who had known him\\r\\nsince he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated\\r\\nrespectability, was not to be hastily rejected.  Neither had\\r\\nanything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends\\r\\nthat could materially lessen its weight.  They had nothing to\\r\\naccuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it\\r\\nwould certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\\r\\nmarket-town where the family did not visit.  It was\\r\\nacknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did\\r\\nmuch good among the poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was\\r\\nnot held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his\\r\\nconcerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly\\r\\nunderstood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting\\r\\nDerbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.\\r\\nDarcy afterwards discharged.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening\\r\\nmore than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it\\r\\nseemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings\\r\\ntowards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole\\r\\nhours endeavouring to make them out.  She certainly did not\\r\\nhate him.  No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had\\r\\nalmost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against\\r\\nhim, that could be so called.  The respect created by the\\r\\nconviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly\\r\\nadmitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her\\r\\nfeeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier\\r\\nnature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing\\r\\nforward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday\\r\\nhad produced.  But above all, above respect and esteem, there\\r\\nwas  a motive within her of goodwill which could not be\\r\\noverlooked.  It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having\\r\\nonce loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all\\r\\nthe petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and\\r\\nall the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.  He who,\\r\\nshe had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,\\r\\nseemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the\\r\\nacquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or\\r\\nany peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were\\r\\nconcerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and\\r\\nbent on making her known to his sister.  Such a change in a\\r\\nman of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but\\r\\ngratitude-- for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as\\r\\nsuch its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by\\r\\nno means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.\\r\\nShe respected, she esteemed, he was grateful to him, she felt a\\r\\nreal interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\\r\\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far\\r\\nit would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the\\r\\npower, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing\\r\\non her the renewal of his addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the\\r\\nniece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s in coming to\\r\\nsee them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she\\r\\nhad reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated,\\r\\nthough it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness\\r\\non their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly\\r\\nexpedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.\\r\\nThey were, therefore, to go.  Elizabeth was pleased; though\\r\\nwhen she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in\\r\\nreply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.  The fishing scheme\\r\\nhad been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement\\r\\nmade of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before\\r\\nnoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 45\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\\'s dislike of\\r\\nher had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\\r\\nunwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and\\r\\nwas curious to know with how much civility on that lady\\'s side\\r\\nthe acquaintance would now be renewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into\\r\\nthe saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for\\r\\nsummer.  Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most\\r\\nrefreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and\\r\\nof the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were\\r\\nscattered over the intermediate lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was\\r\\nsitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady\\r\\nwith whom she lived in London.  Georgiana\\'s reception of them\\r\\nwas very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which,\\r\\nthough proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong,\\r\\nwould easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief\\r\\nof her being proud and reserved.  Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\\r\\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\\r\\ncurtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\\r\\npauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.  It was\\r\\nfirst broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking\\r\\nwoman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse\\r\\nproved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others;\\r\\nand between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\\r\\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.  Miss Darcy looked\\r\\nas if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes\\r\\ndid venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its\\r\\nbeing heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\\r\\nBingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\\r\\nDarcy, without calling her attention.  This observation would not\\r\\nhave prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not\\r\\nbeen seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to\\r\\nbe spared the necessity of saying much.  Her own thoughts were\\r\\nemploying her.  She expected every moment that some of the\\r\\ngentlemen would enter the room.  She wished, she feared that\\r\\nthe master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\\r\\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.\\r\\nAfter sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from\\r\\nher a cold inquiry after the health of her family.  She answered\\r\\nwith equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by\\r\\nthe entrance of the servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety\\r\\nof all the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a\\r\\nvariety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take\\r\\nplace till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.\\r\\nAnnesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her\\r\\npost.  There was now employment for the whole party-- for\\r\\nthough they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\\r\\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon\\r\\ncollected them round the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\\r\\nwhether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\\r\\nand then, though but a moment before she had believed her\\r\\nwishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or\\r\\nthree other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river,\\r\\nand had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family\\r\\nintended a visit to Georgiana that morning.  No sooner did he\\r\\nappear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and\\r\\nunembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but\\r\\nperhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the\\r\\nsuspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and\\r\\nthat there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his\\r\\nbehaviour when he first came into the room.  In no countenance\\r\\nwas attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s,\\r\\nin spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she\\r\\nspoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her\\r\\ndesperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means\\r\\nover.  Miss Darcy, on her brother\\'s entrance, exerted herself\\r\\nmuch more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that she was anxious for\\r\\nhis sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much\\r\\nas possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.  Miss\\r\\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger,\\r\\ntook the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from\\r\\nMeryton?  They must be a great loss to YOUR family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name;\\r\\nbut Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in\\r\\nher thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him\\r\\ngave her a moment\\'s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to\\r\\nrepel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question\\r\\nin a tolerably detached tone.  While she spoke, an involuntary\\r\\nglance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,\\r\\nearnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion,\\r\\nand unable to lift up her eyes.  Had Miss Bingley know what\\r\\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly\\r\\nwould have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended\\r\\nto discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man\\r\\nto whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility\\r\\nwhich might injure her in Darcy\\'s opinion, and, perhaps, to\\r\\nremind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some\\r\\npart of her family were connected with that corps.  Not a\\r\\nsyllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s meditated\\r\\nelopement.  To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\\r\\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s\\r\\nconnections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it,\\r\\nfrom the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to\\r\\nhim, of their becoming hereafter her own.  He had certainly\\r\\nformed such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect\\r\\nhis endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable\\r\\n that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare\\r\\nof his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\\r\\nemotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared\\r\\nnot approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in\\r\\ntime, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her\\r\\nbrother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her\\r\\ninterest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been\\r\\ndesigned to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\\r\\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer\\r\\nabove mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to\\r\\ntheir carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms\\r\\non Elizabeth\\'s person, behaviour, and dress.  But Georgiana\\r\\nwould not join her.  Her brother\\'s recommendation was enough\\r\\nto ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had\\r\\nspoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without\\r\\nthe power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.\\r\\nWhen Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\\r\\n repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\"\\r\\nshe cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\\r\\nis since the winter.  She is grown so brown and coarse!  Louisa\\r\\nand I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\\r\\ncontented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no\\r\\nother alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\\r\\nconsequence of travelling in the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never\\r\\ncould see any beauty in her.  Her face is too thin; her\\r\\ncomplexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all\\r\\nhandsome.  Her nose wants character-- there is nothing marked\\r\\nin its lines.  Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common\\r\\nway; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so\\r\\nfine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.  They\\r\\nhave a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her\\r\\nair altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is\\r\\nintolerable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth,\\r\\nthis was not the best method of recommending herself; but\\r\\nangry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look\\r\\nsomewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.  He was\\r\\nresolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making\\r\\nhim speak, she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how\\r\\namazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\\r\\nparticularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\\r\\ndining at Netherfield, \\'SHE a beauty!  I should as soon call her\\r\\nmother a wit.\\'  But afterwards she seemed to improve on you,\\r\\nand I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but\\r\\nTHAT was only when I first saw her, for it is many months\\r\\nsince I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of\\r\\nmy acquaintances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\\r\\nsatisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\\r\\npain but herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned,\\r\\nexcept what had particularly interested them both.  The look and behaviour of everybody they had\\r\\nseen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.  They talked\\r\\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit-- of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing\\r\\nto know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified\\r\\nby her niece\\'s beginning the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 46\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival\\r\\nat Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now\\r\\nbeen spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of\\r\\ntwo letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.\\r\\nElizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to\\r\\nenjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.  The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\\r\\nwritten five days ago.  The beginning contained an account of\\r\\nall their little parties and engagements, with such news as the\\r\\ncountry afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day\\r\\nlater, and written in evident agitation, gave more important\\r\\nintelligence.  It was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\\r\\nof a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of\\r\\nalarming you-- be assured that we are all well.  What I have to\\r\\nsay relates to poor Lydia.  An express came at twelve last night,\\r\\n just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to\\r\\ninform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his\\r\\nofficers; to own the truth, with Wickham!  Imagine our surprise.\\r\\nTo Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.  I\\r\\nam very, very sorry.  So imprudent a match on both sides! But I\\r\\nam willing to hope the best, and that his character has been\\r\\nmisunderstood.  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe\\r\\nhim, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad\\r\\nat heart.  His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know\\r\\nmy father can give her nothing.  Our poor mother is sadly\\r\\ngrieved.  My father bears it better.  How thankful am I that we\\r\\nnever let them know what has been said against him!  we must\\r\\nforget it ourselves.  They were off Saturday night about twelve,\\r\\nas is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\\r\\neight.  The express was sent off directly.  My dear Lizzy, they\\r\\nmust have passed within ten miles of us.  Colonel Forster gives\\r\\nus reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his\\r\\nwife, informing her of their intention.  I must conclude, for I\\r\\ncannot be long from my poor mother.  I am afraid you will not\\r\\nbe able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\\r\\nknowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly\\r\\nseized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read\\r\\nas follows:  it had been written a day later than the conclusion of\\r\\nthe first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\\r\\nletter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\\r\\nconfined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\\r\\nfor being coherent.  Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\\r\\nwrite, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\r\\nImprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor\\r\\nLydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken\\r\\nplace, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\\r\\nto Scotland.  Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left\\r\\nBrighton the day before, not many hours after the express.\\r\\nThough Lydia\\'s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand\\r\\nthat they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped\\r\\nby Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go\\r\\nthere, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel\\r\\nF., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B., intending to\\r\\ntrace their route.  He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no\\r\\nfurther; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\\r\\ncoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\\r\\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue\\r\\nthe London road.  I know not what to think.  After making\\r\\nevery possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on\\r\\ninto Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes,\\r\\nand at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--\\r\\nno such people had been seen to pass through.  With the kindest\\r\\nconcern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\\r\\nto us in a manner most creditable to his heart.  I am sincerely\\r\\ngrieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame\\r\\non them.  Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.  My father\\r\\nand mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.\\r\\nMany circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be\\r\\nmarried privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even\\r\\nif HE could form such a design against a young woman of\\r\\nLydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so\\r\\nlost to everything?  Impossible!  I grieve to find, however, that\\r\\nColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he\\r\\nshook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W.\\r\\nwas not a man to be trusted.  My poor mother is really ill, and\\r\\nkeeps her room.  Could she exert herself, it would be better; but\\r\\nthis is not to be expected.  And as to my father, I never in my\\r\\nlife saw him so affected.  Poor Kitty has anger for having\\r\\nconcealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,\\r\\none cannot wonder.  I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\\r\\nhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but\\r\\nnow, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your\\r\\nreturn?  I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\\r\\ninconvenient.  Adieu!  I take up my pen again to do what I\\r\\nhave just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that\\r\\nI cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as\\r\\npossible.  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\r\\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\\r\\nask of the former.  My father is going to London with Colonel\\r\\nForster instantly, to try to discover her.  What he means to do\\r\\nI am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow\\r\\nhim to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and\\r\\nColonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow\\r\\nevening.  In such and exigence, my uncle\\'s advice and assistance\\r\\nwould be everything in the world; he will immediately\\r\\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from\\r\\nher seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,\\r\\nwithout losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she\\r\\nreached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy\\r\\nappeared.  Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start,\\r\\nand before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose\\r\\nmind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation, hastily\\r\\nexclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.  I must\\r\\nfind Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be\\r\\ndelayed; I have not an instant to loose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling\\r\\nthan politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you\\r\\na minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner.  You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she\\r\\nfelt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\r\\nCalling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him,\\r\\nthough in so breathless an accent as made her almost\\r\\nunintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support\\r\\nherself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for\\r\\nDarcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of\\r\\ngentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid.  Is\\r\\nthere nothing you could take to give you present relief?  A\\r\\nglass of wine; shall I get you one?  You are very ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\r\\n \"There is nothing the matter with me.  I am quite well; I am\\r\\nonly distressed by some dreadful news which I have just\\r\\nreceived from Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes\\r\\ncould not speak another word.  Darcy, in wretched suspense,\\r\\ncould only say something indistinctly of his concern, and\\r\\nobserve her in compassionate silence.  At length she spoke\\r\\nagain.  \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful\\r\\nnews. It cannot be concealed from any one.  My younger sister\\r\\nhas left all her friends-- has eloped; has thrown herself into the\\r\\npower of-- of Mr. Wickham.  They are gone off together from\\r\\nBrighton.  YOU know him too well to doubt the rest.  She has\\r\\nno money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to-- she\\r\\nis lost for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.  \"When I consider,\" she added\\r\\nin a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it!\\r\\nI, who knew what he was.  Had I but explained some part of\\r\\nit only-- some part of what I learnt, to my own family!  Had his\\r\\ncharacter been known, this could not have happened.  But it is\\r\\nall-- all too late now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved-- shocked.  But is\\r\\nit certain-- absolutely certain?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and\\r\\nwere traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are\\r\\ncertainly not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\\r\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my\\r\\nuncle\\'s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in\\r\\nhalf-an-hour.  But nothing can be done-- I know very well that\\r\\nnothing can be done.  How is such a man to be worked on?\\r\\nHow are they even to be discovered?  I have not the smallest\\r\\nhope.  It is every way horrible!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When MY eyes were opened to his real character-- Oh! had I\\r\\nknown what I ought, what I dared to do!  But I knew not-- I\\r\\nwas afraid of doing too much.  Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and\\r\\nwas walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his\\r\\nbrow contracted, his air gloomy.  Elizabeth soon observed, and\\r\\ninstantly understood it.  Her power was sinking; everything\\r\\nMUST sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an\\r\\nassurance of the deepest disgrace.  She could neither wonder\\r\\nnor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\\r\\nto her consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her\\r\\ndistress.  It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her\\r\\nunderstand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt\\r\\nthat she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be\\r\\nvain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.  Lydia--\\r\\nthe humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon\\r\\nswallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her\\r\\nhandkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and,\\r\\nafter a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of\\r\\nher situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner\\r\\nwhich, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint,\\r\\nsaid, \"I am afraid you have been  long desiring my absence, nor\\r\\nhave I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though\\r\\nunavailing concern.  Would to Heaven that anything could be\\r\\neither said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\\r\\nsuch distress!  But I will not torment you with vain wishes,\\r\\nwhich may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.  This\\r\\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\'s having the\\r\\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes.  Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.  Say\\r\\nthat urgent business calls us home immediately.  Conceal the\\r\\nunhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his\\r\\nsorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than\\r\\nthere was at present reason to hope, and leaving his\\r\\ncompliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting\\r\\nlook went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was\\r\\nthat they should ever see each other again on such terms of\\r\\ncordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire;\\r\\nand as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their\\r\\nacquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at\\r\\nthe perverseness of those feelings which would now have\\r\\npromoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in\\r\\nits termination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor\\r\\nfaulty.  But if otherwise-- if regard springing from such sources\\r\\nis unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often\\r\\ndescribed as arising on a first interview with its object, and even\\r\\nbefore two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in\\r\\nher defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the\\r\\nlatter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill\\r\\nsuccess might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less\\r\\ninteresting mode of attachment.  Be that as it may, she saw him\\r\\ngo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy\\r\\nmust produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that\\r\\nwretched business.  Never, since reading Jane\\'s second letter,\\r\\nhad she entertained a hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her.\\r\\nNo one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an\\r\\nexpectation.  Surprise was the least of her feelings on this\\r\\ndevelopment.  While the contents of the first letter remained in\\r\\nher mind, she was all surprise-- all astonishment that Wickham\\r\\nshould marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for\\r\\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had\\r\\nappeared incomprehensible.  But no it was all too natural. For\\r\\nsuch an attachment as this she might have sufficient charm; and\\r\\nthough she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in\\r\\nan elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no\\r\\ndifficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her\\r\\nunderstanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in\\r\\nHertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was\\r\\nconvinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach\\r\\nherself to anybody.  Sometimes one officer, sometimes another,\\r\\nhad been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her\\r\\nopinion.  Her affections had continually been fluctuating but\\r\\nnever without an object.  The mischief of neglect and mistaken\\r\\nindulgence towards such a girl-- oh! how acutely did she now\\r\\nfeel it!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was wild to be at home-- to hear, to see, to be upon the\\r\\nspot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly\\r\\nupon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother\\r\\nincapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and\\r\\nthough almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia,\\r\\nher uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and\\r\\ntill he entered the room her impatience was severe.  Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the\\r\\nservant\\'s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\\r\\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated\\r\\nthe cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and\\r\\ndwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy,\\r\\nthough Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted.  Not Lydia\\r\\nonly, but all were concerned in it; and after the first\\r\\nexclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised\\r\\nevery assistance in his power.  Elizabeth, though expecting no\\r\\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being\\r\\nactuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was\\r\\nspeedily settled.  They were to be off as soon as possible.  \"But\\r\\nwhat is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner.\\r\\n\"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it\\r\\nso?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\\r\\nengagement.  THAT is all settled.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her\\r\\nroom to prepare.  \"And are they upon such terms as for her to\\r\\ndisclose the real truth?  Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her\\r\\nin the hurry and confusion of the following hour.  Had Elizabeth\\r\\nbeen at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that\\r\\nall employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself;\\r\\nbut she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and\\r\\namongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their\\r\\nfriends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden\\r\\ndeparture.  An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and\\r\\nMr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn,\\r\\nnothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all\\r\\nthe misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of\\r\\ntime than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and\\r\\non the road to Longbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 47\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle,\\r\\nas they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious\\r\\nconsideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\\r\\nyour eldest sister does on the matter.  It appears to me so very\\r\\nunlikely that any young man should form such a design against\\r\\na girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who\\r\\nwas actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I am strongly\\r\\ninclined to hope the best.  Could he expect that her friends\\r\\nwould not step forward?  Could he expect to be noticed again\\r\\nby the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?  His\\r\\ntemptation is not adequate to the risk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your\\r\\nuncle\\'s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,\\r\\nhonour, and interest, for him to be guilty of.  I cannot think so\\r\\nvery ill of Wickham.  Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give\\r\\nhim up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\r\\nneglect I can believe him capable.  If, indeed, it should be so!\\r\\nBut I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland\\r\\nif that had been the case?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute\\r\\nproof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\\r\\nsuch a presumption!  And, besides, no traces of them were to be\\r\\nfound on the Barnet road.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then-- supposing them to be in London.  They may be there,\\r\\nthough for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\\r\\npurpose.  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\\r\\neither side; and it might strike them that they could be more\\r\\neconomically, though less expeditiously, married in London\\r\\nthan in Scotland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why all this secrecy?  Why any fear of detection?  Why must\\r\\ntheir marriage be private?  Oh, no, no-- this is not likely.  His\\r\\nmost particular friend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was\\r\\npersuaded of his never intending to marry her.  Wickham will\\r\\nnever marry a woman without some money.  He cannot afford\\r\\nit.  And what claims has Lydia-- what attraction has she beyond\\r\\nyouth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her\\r\\nsake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying\\r\\nwell?  As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the\\r\\ncorps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am\\r\\nnot able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a\\r\\nstep might produce.  But as to your other objection, I am afraid\\r\\nit will hardly hold good.  Lydia has no brothers to step forward;\\r\\nand he might imagine, from my father\\'s behaviour, from his\\r\\nindolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to\\r\\nwhat was going forward in his family, that HE would do as\\r\\nlittle, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such\\r\\na matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\\r\\nof him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\nwith tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and\\r\\nvirtue in such a point should admit of doubt.  But, really, I\\r\\nknow not what to say.  Perhaps I am not doing her justice.  But\\r\\nshe is very young; she has never been taught to think on\\r\\nserious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\\r\\ntwelvemonth-- she has been given up to nothing but amusement\\r\\nand vanity.  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the\\r\\nmost idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that\\r\\ncame in her way.  Since the  ----shire were first quartered in\\r\\nMeryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in\\r\\nher head.  She has been doing everything in her power by\\r\\nthinking and talking on the subject, to give greater-- what shall\\r\\nI call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively\\r\\nenough.  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\\r\\nperson and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very\\r\\nill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?  And who is there, whatever\\r\\nmight be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\\r\\nsuch an attempt, till it were proved against them?  But Jane\\r\\nknows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.  We both know\\r\\nthat he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he\\r\\nhas neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful\\r\\nas he is insinuating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\\r\\ncuriosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring.  \"I told you, the\\r\\nother day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\\r\\nyourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he\\r\\nspoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and\\r\\nliberality towards him.  And there are other circumstances which\\r\\nI am not at liberty-- which it is not worth while to relate; but his\\r\\nlies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what\\r\\nhe said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\\r\\nreserved, disagreeable girl.  Yet he knew to the contrary himself.\\r\\nHe must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we\\r\\nhave found her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this?  can she be ignorant of\\r\\nwhat you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and\\r\\nsaw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\\r\\nFitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.  And when I\\r\\nreturned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\\r\\nfortnight\\'s time.  As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I\\r\\nrelated the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\\r\\nknowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\\r\\none, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of\\r\\nhim should then be overthrown?  And even when it was settled\\r\\nthat Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\\r\\nher eyes to his character never occurred to me.  That SHE could\\r\\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head.\\r\\nThat such a consequence as THIS could ensue, you may easily\\r\\nbelieve, was far enough from my thoughts.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no\\r\\nreason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the slightest.  I can remember no symptom of affection on\\r\\neither side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\\r\\nmust be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\\r\\nthrown away.  When first he entered the corps, she was ready\\r\\nenough to admire him; but so we all were.  Every girl in or near\\r\\nMeryton was out of her senses about him for the first two\\r\\nmonths; but he never distinguished HER by any particular\\r\\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of\\r\\nextravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way,\\r\\nand others of the regiment, who treated her with more\\r\\ndistinction, again became her favourites.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be\\r\\nadded to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting\\r\\nsubject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them\\r\\nfrom it long, during the whole of the journey.  From Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\nthoughts it was never absent.  Fixed there by the keenest of all\\r\\nanguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or\\r\\nforgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\\r\\nnight on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next\\r\\nday.  It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could\\r\\nnot have been wearied by long expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\\r\\nstanding on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\\r\\nand, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\\r\\nthat lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole\\r\\nbodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing\\r\\nearnest of their welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\\r\\nkiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\\r\\ndown from her mother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled\\r\\nthe eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything\\r\\nhad been heard of the fugitives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane.  \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I\\r\\nhope everything will be well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have heard only twice.  He wrote me a few lines on\\r\\nWednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me\\r\\nhis directions, which I particularly begged him to do.  He merely\\r\\nadded that he should not write again till he had something of\\r\\nimportance to mention.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And my mother-- how is she?  How are you all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\\r\\ngreatly shaken.  She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction\\r\\nin seeing you all.  She does not yet leave her dressing-room.\\r\\nMary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you-- how are you?\" cried Elizabeth.  \"You look pale.\\r\\nHow much you must have gone through!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\\r\\ntheir conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nGardiner were engaged with their children,. Was now put an end\\r\\nto by the approach of the whole party.  Jane ran to her uncle and\\r\\naunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate\\r\\nsmiles and tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\\r\\nElizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\\r\\nothers, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to\\r\\ngive.  The sanguine hope of good, however, which the\\r\\nbenevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;\\r\\nshe still expected that it would all end well, and that every\\r\\nmorning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her\\r\\nfather, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce\\r\\ntheir marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\\r\\nminutes\\' conversation together, received them exactly as might\\r\\nbe expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\\r\\nagainst the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of\\r\\nher own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the\\r\\nperson to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her\\r\\ndaughter must principally be owing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going to\\r\\nBrighton, with all my family, THIS would not have happened;\\r\\nbut poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.  Why did\\r\\nthe Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?  I am sure there\\r\\nwas some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\\r\\nkind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after.\\r\\nI always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her;\\r\\nbut I was overruled, as I always am.  Poor dear child!  And now\\r\\nhere\\'s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\r\\nWickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\\r\\nwhat is to become of us all?  The Collinses will turn us out\\r\\nbefore he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\\r\\nbrother, I do not know what we shall do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\\r\\nafter general assurances of his affection for her and all her\\r\\nfamily, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\\r\\nand would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\\r\\nLydia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is\\r\\nright to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look\\r\\non it a certain.  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\\r\\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we\\r\\nknow that they are not married, and have no design of marrying,\\r\\ndo not let us give the matter over as lost.  As soon as I get to\\r\\ntown I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with\\r\\nme to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as\\r\\nto what is to be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly\\r\\nwhat I could most wish for.  And now do, when you get to\\r\\ntown, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not\\r\\nmarried already, MAKE them marry.  And as for wedding\\r\\nclothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall\\r\\nhave as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they\\r\\nare married.  And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\\r\\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out\\r\\nof my wits-- and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all\\r\\nover me-- such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and\\r\\nsuch beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.\\r\\nAnd tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her\\r\\nclothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are\\r\\nthe best warehouses.  Oh, brother, how kind you are!  I know\\r\\nyou will contrive it all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\\r\\nendeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending\\r\\nmoderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after\\r\\ntalking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they\\r\\nall left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who\\r\\nattended in the absence of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\\r\\nreal occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\\r\\nattempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\\r\\nenough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they\\r\\nwaited at table, and judged it better that ONE only of the\\r\\nhousehold, and the one whom they could most trust should\\r\\ncomprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty,\\r\\nwho had been  too busily engaged in their separate apartments\\r\\nto make their appearance before.  One came from her books,\\r\\nand the other from her toilette.  The faces of both, however,\\r\\nwere tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except\\r\\nthat the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had\\r\\nherself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness\\r\\nthan usual to the accents of Kitty.  As for Mary, she was\\r\\nmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a\\r\\ncountenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\\r\\ntable:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\\r\\ntalked of.  But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into\\r\\nthe wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly\\r\\nconsolation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\\r\\nadded, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw\\r\\nfrom it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\\r\\nirretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\\r\\nthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that\\r\\nshe cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\\r\\nundeserving of the other sex.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\\r\\noppressed to make any reply.  Mary, however, continued to\\r\\nconsole herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil\\r\\nbefore them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\r\\nhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\\r\\nherself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane\\r\\nwas equally eager to satisfy.  After joining in general\\r\\nlamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\\r\\nElizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\\r\\nnot assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\\r\\nsubject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which\\r\\nI have not already heard.  Give me further particulars.  What did\\r\\nColonel Forster say?  Had they no apprehension of anything\\r\\nbefore the elopement took place?  They must have seen them\\r\\ntogether for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\\r\\npartiality, especially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any\\r\\nalarm.  I am so grieved for him!  His behaviour was attentive and\\r\\nkind to the utmost.  He WAS coming to us, in order to assure us\\r\\nof his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to\\r\\nScotland:  when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\\r\\nhis journey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?\\r\\nDid he know of their intending to go off?  Had Colonel Forster\\r\\nseen Denny himself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied knowing\\r\\nanything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\\r\\nabout it.  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\\r\\nmarrying-- and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might\\r\\nhave been misunderstood before.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\\r\\nentertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?\\r\\nI felt a little uneasy-- a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with\\r\\nhim in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been\\r\\nalways quite right.  My father and mother knew nothing of that;\\r\\nthey only felt how imprudent a match it must be.  Kitty then\\r\\nowned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the\\r\\nrest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter she had prepared her for\\r\\nsuch a step.  She had known, it seems, of their being in love with\\r\\neach other, many weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham\\r\\nhimself?  Does he know he real character?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\\r\\nformerly did.  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\r\\nAnd since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left\\r\\nMeryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew\\r\\nof him, this could not have happened!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister.  \"But to\\r\\nexpose the former faults of any person without knowing what\\r\\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.  We acted with\\r\\nthe best intentions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to\\r\\nhis wife?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\r\\nThese were the contents:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,--\\r\\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot\\r\\nhelp laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as\\r\\nsoon as I am missed.  I am going to Gretna Green, and if you\\r\\ncannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there\\r\\nis but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.  I should\\r\\nnever be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.  You\\r\\nneed not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do\\r\\nnot like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write\\r\\nto them and sign my name \\'Lydia Wickham.\\'  What a good joke\\r\\nit will be!  I can hardly write for laughing.  Pray make my\\r\\nexcuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing\\r\\nwith him to-night.  Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he\\r\\nknows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we\\r\\nmeet, with great pleasure.  I shall send for my clothes when I\\r\\nget to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a\\r\\ngreat slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.\\r\\nGood-bye.  Give my love to Colonel Forster.  I hope you will\\r\\ndrink to our good journey.  Your affectionate friend,\\r\\n                              \"Lydia Bennet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she\\r\\nhad finished it.  What a letter is this, to be written at such a\\r\\nmoment!  But at least it shows that SHE was serious on the\\r\\nsubject of their journey.  Whatever he might afterwards\\r\\npersuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of\\r\\ninfamy.  My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI never saw any one so shocked.  He could not speak a word\\r\\nfor full ten minutes.  My mother was taken ill immediately, and\\r\\nthe whole house in such confusion!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it\\r\\nwho did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  I hope there was.  But to be guarded at such a\\r\\ntime is very difficult.  My mother was in hysterics, and though I\\r\\nendeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am\\r\\nafraid I did not do so much as I might have done!  But the\\r\\nhorror of what might possibly happen almost took from me\\r\\nmy faculties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.  You do\\r\\nnot look well.  Oh that I had been with you!  you have had every\\r\\ncare and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\\r\\nevery fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of\\r\\nthem.  Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\\r\\nthat her hours of repose should not be broken in on.  My aunt\\r\\nPhillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went\\r\\naway; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.  She\\r\\nwas of great use and comfort to us all.  And Lady Lucas has\\r\\nbeen very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\\r\\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her\\r\\ndaughters\\', if they should be of use to us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps\\r\\nshe MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\\r\\ncannot see too little of one\\'s neighbours.  Assistance is\\r\\nimpossible; condolence insufferable.  Let them triumph over us\\r\\nat a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her\\r\\nfather had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of\\r\\nhis daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place\\r\\nwhere they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\\r\\nanything could be made out from them.  His principal object\\r\\nmust be to discover the number of the hackney coach which\\r\\ntook them from Clapham.  It had come with a fare from\\r\\nLondon; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\\r\\ngentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another\\r\\nmight be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.  If\\r\\nhe could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had\\r\\nbefore set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there,\\r\\nand hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and\\r\\nnumber of the coach.  I do not know of any other designs that\\r\\nhe had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his\\r\\nspirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\\r\\nout even so much as this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 48\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\\r\\nnext morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\\r\\nfrom him.  His family knew him to be, on all common occasions,\\r\\na most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\\r\\nthey had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that\\r\\nhe had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of THAT they\\r\\nwould have been glad to be certain.  Mr. Gardiner had waited\\r\\nonly for the letters before he set off.\\r\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\\r\\nconstant information of what was going on, and their uncle\\r\\npromised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\\r\\nLongbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\\r\\nsister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\'s\\r\\nnot being killed in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire\\r\\na few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\\r\\nserviceable to her nieces.  She shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\\r\\nfreedom.  Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\\r\\nalways, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\\r\\nthem up-- though, as she never came without reporting some\\r\\nfresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity, she\\r\\nseldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than\\r\\nshe found them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\\r\\nmonths before, had been almost an angel of light.  He was\\r\\ndeclared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his\\r\\nintrigues all honoured with the title of seduction, had been\\r\\nextended into every tradesman\\'s family.  Everybody declared\\r\\nthat he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\\r\\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted\\r\\nthe appearance of his goodness.  Elizabeth, though she did not\\r\\ncredit above half of what was said, believed enough to make\\r\\nher former assurance of her sister\\'s ruin more certain; and even\\r\\nJane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more\\r\\nespecially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to\\r\\nScotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they\\r\\nmust in all probability have gained some news of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\\r\\nreceived a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he\\r\\nhad immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to\\r\\ncome to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to\\r\\nEpsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining\\r\\nany satisfactory information; and that he was now determined\\r\\nto inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\\r\\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on\\r\\ntheir first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.\\r\\nMr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this\\r\\nmeasure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist\\r\\nhim in pursuing it.  He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly\\r\\ndisinclined at present to leave London and promised to write\\r\\nagain very soon.  There was also a postscript to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\r\\npossible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the\\r\\nregiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections\\r\\nwho would be likely to know in what part of town he has now\\r\\nconcealed himself.  If there were any one that one could apply\\r\\nto with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be\\r\\nof essential consequence.  At present we have nothing to guide\\r\\nus.  Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power\\r\\nto satisfy us on this head.  But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\\r\\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than\\r\\nany other person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this\\r\\ndeference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her\\r\\npower to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the\\r\\ncompliment deserved.  She had never heard of his having had\\r\\nany relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had\\r\\nbeen dead many years.  It was possible, however, that some of\\r\\nhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more\\r\\ninformation; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\\r\\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\\r\\nanxious part of each was when the post was expected.  The\\r\\narrival of letters was the grand object of every morning\\'s\\r\\nimpatience.  Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be\\r\\ntold would be communicated, and every succeeding day was\\r\\nexpected to bring some news of importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\\r\\nfor their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\\r\\nwhich, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\\r\\nhim in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who\\r\\nknew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her,\\r\\nand read it likewise. It was s follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR SIR,--\\r\\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in\\r\\nlife, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\\r\\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\\r\\nfrom Hertfordshire.  Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins\\r\\nand myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your\\r\\nrespectable family, in your present distress, which must be of\\r\\nthe bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no\\r\\n time can remove.  No arguments shall be wanting on my part\\r\\nthat can alleviate so severe a misfortune-- or that may comfort\\r\\nyou, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most\\r\\nafflicting to a parent\\'s mind.  The death of your daughter would\\r\\nhave been a blessing in comparison of  this.  And it is the more\\r\\nto be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear\\r\\nCharlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in\\r\\nyour daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;\\r\\nthough, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition\\r\\nmust be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an\\r\\nenormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are\\r\\ngrievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by\\r\\nMrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter,\\r\\nto whom I have related the affair.  They agree with me in\\r\\napprehending that this false step in one daughter will be\\r\\ninjurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady\\r\\nCatherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\\r\\nwith such a family?  And this consideration leads me moreover\\r\\nto reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last\\r\\nNovember; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\\r\\nin all your sorrow and disgrace.  Let me then advise you, dear\\r\\nsir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your\\r\\nunworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\\r\\nreap the fruits of her own heinous offense.-- I am, dear sir, etc.,\\r\\netc.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\\r\\nfrom Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\\r\\nnature to send.  It was not known that Wickham had a single\\r\\nrelationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was\\r\\ncertain that he had no  near one living.  His former\\r\\nacquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the\\r\\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular\\r\\nfriendship with any of them.  There was no one, therefore, who\\r\\ncould be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.  And in\\r\\nthe wretched state of his own finances, there was a very\\r\\npowerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery\\r\\nby Lydia\\'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left\\r\\ngaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\\r\\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds\\r\\nwould be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.  He owed\\r\\na good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\\r\\nformidable.  Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these\\r\\nparticulars from the Longbourn family.  Jane heard them with\\r\\nhorror.  \"A gamester!\" she cried.  \"This is wholly unexpected.\\r\\nI had not an idea of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\\r\\ntheir father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\r\\nRendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he\\r\\nhad yielded to his brother-in-law\\'s entreaty that he would return\\r\\nto his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might\\r\\nsuggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.  When Mrs.\\r\\nBennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction\\r\\nas her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his\\r\\nlife had been before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she cried.\\r\\n\"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.  Who\\r\\nis to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes\\r\\naway?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled\\r\\nthat she and the children should go to London, at the same time\\r\\nthat Mr. Bennet came from it.  The coach, therefore, took them\\r\\nthe first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to\\r\\nLongbourn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth\\r\\nand her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part\\r\\nof the world.  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned\\r\\nbefore them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which\\r\\nMrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter\\r\\nfrom him, had ended in nothing.  Elizabeth had received none\\r\\nsince her return that could come from Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other\\r\\nexcuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,\\r\\ntherefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though\\r\\nElizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with\\r\\nher own feelings, was perfectly  aware that, had she known\\r\\nnothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia\\'s\\r\\ninfamy somewhat better.  It would have spared her, she thought,\\r\\none sleepless night out of two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\r\\nphilosophic composure.  He said as little as he had ever been in\\r\\nthe habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\\r\\ntaken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\\r\\ncourage to speak of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\\r\\nthat Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\\r\\nher briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have\\r\\nendured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that.  Who should suffer\\r\\nbut myself?  It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil.  Human nature is\\r\\nso prone to fall into it!  No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel\\r\\nhow much I have been to blame.  I am not afraid of being\\r\\noverpowered by the impression.  It will pass away soon enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her residence\\r\\nthere will probably be of some duration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen after a short silence he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to\\r\\nme last May, which, considering the event, shows some\\r\\ngreatness of mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\\r\\nmother\\'s tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives such\\r\\nan elegance to misfortune!  Another day I will do the same; I\\r\\nwill sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and\\r\\ngive as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till\\r\\nKitty runs away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully.  \"If I\\r\\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"YOU go to Brighton.  I would not trust you so near it as\\r\\nEastbourne for fifty pounds!  No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\\r\\nbe cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.  No officer is ever\\r\\nto enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\\r\\nvillage.  Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\\r\\nwith one of your sisters.  And you are never to stir out of doors\\r\\ntill you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\\r\\nin a rational manner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy.  If you\\r\\nare a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\\r\\nat the end of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 49\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\\r\\nwalking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw\\r\\nthe housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she\\r\\ncame to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her;\\r\\nbut, instead of the expected summons, when they approached\\r\\nher, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon, madam, for\\r\\ninterrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\\r\\ngood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, Hill?  We have heard nothing from town.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t\\r\\nyou know there is an express come for master from Mr.\\r\\nGardiner?  He has been here this half-hour, and master has had\\r\\na letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\r\\nThey ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\\r\\nthence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were\\r\\non the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when\\r\\nthey were met by the butler, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking\\r\\ntowards the little copse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\\r\\nonce more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\\r\\ndeliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side\\r\\nof the paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running\\r\\nas Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\\r\\nbreath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, papa, what news-- what news?  Have you heard from my\\r\\nuncle?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring-- good or bad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the\\r\\nletter from his pocket.  \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.  Jane now came\\r\\nup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know myself what\\r\\nit is about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n                    \"Gracechurch Street, Monday,\"\\r\\n                              \"August 2.\\r\\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,--\\r\\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and\\r\\nsuch as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.\\r\\nSoon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to\\r\\nfind out in what part of London they were.  The particulars I\\r\\nreserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.\\r\\nI have seen them both-- \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth read on:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have seen them both.  They are not married, nor can I find\\r\\nthere was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\\r\\nperform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\\r\\nyour side, I hope it will not be long before they are.  All that is\\r\\nrequired of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\\r\\nequal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\\r\\nchildren after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\r\\nmoreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\\r\\nyour life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\r\\nwhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\\r\\nwith, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.  I shall send\\r\\nthis by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your\\r\\nanswer.  You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\\r\\nthat Mr. Wickham\\'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they\\r\\nare generally believed to be.  The world has been deceived in\\r\\nthat respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little\\r\\nmoney, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my\\r\\nniece, in addition to her own fortune.  If, as I conclude will be\\r\\nthe case, you send me full powers to act in your name\\r\\nthroughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give\\r\\ndirections to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.\\r\\nThere will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town\\r\\nagain; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my\\r\\ndiligence and care.  Send back your answer as fast as you can,\\r\\nand be careful to write explicitly.  We have judged it best that\\r\\nmy niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\\r\\nyou will approve.  She comes to us to-day.  I shall write again as\\r\\nsoon as anything more is determined on.  Yours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"EDW. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.  \"Can it\\r\\nbe possible that he will marry her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\" said\\r\\nher sister.  \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time\\r\\nbefore he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write\\r\\nimmediately.  Consider how important every moment is in such\\r\\na case.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble\\r\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards\\r\\nthe house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I suppose,\\r\\nmust be complied with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Complied with!  I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they MUST marry!  Yet he is SUCH a man!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry.  There is nothing else to be done.\\r\\nBut there are two things that I want very much to know; one is,\\r\\nhow much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about;\\r\\nand the other, how am I ever to pay him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Money!  My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so\\r\\nslight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and\\r\\nfifty after I am gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred\\r\\nto me before.  His debts to be discharged, and something still to\\r\\nremain!  Oh! it must be my uncle\\'s doings!  Generous, good\\r\\nman, I am afraid he has distressed himself.  A small sum could\\r\\nnot do all this.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham\\'s a fool if he takes her with a\\r\\nfarthing less than ten thousand pounds.  I should be sorry to\\r\\nthink so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten thousand pounds!  Heaven forbid!  How is half such a\\r\\nsum to be repaid?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\\r\\ncontinued silent till they reached the house.  Their father then\\r\\nwent on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\\r\\nbreakfast-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as soon\\r\\nas they were by themselves.  \"How strange this is!  And for\\r\\nTHIS we are to be thankful.  That they should marry, small as\\r\\nis their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character,\\r\\nwe are forced to rejoice.  Oh, Lydia!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly\\r\\nwould not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.\\r\\nThough our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\\r\\nhim, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\\r\\nit, has been advanced.  He has children of his own, and may\\r\\nhave more.  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been,\"\\r\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our\\r\\nsister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\\r\\nthem, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.  The\\r\\nkindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.  Their\\r\\ntaking her home, and affording her their personal protection and\\r\\ncountenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of\\r\\ngratitude cannot enough acknowledge.  By this time she is\\r\\nactually with them!  If such goodness does not make her\\r\\nmiserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!  What a\\r\\nmeeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\"\\r\\nsaid Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.  His\\r\\nconsenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come\\r\\nto a right way of thinking.  Their mutual affection will steady\\r\\nthem; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in\\r\\nso rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence\\r\\nforgotten.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as neither\\r\\nyou, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.  It is useless to talk of\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\\r\\nlikelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.  They went\\r\\nto the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would\\r\\nnot wish them to make it known to her.  He was writing and,\\r\\nwithout raising his head, coolly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\\r\\nupstairs together.  Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\\r\\none communication would, therefore, do for all.  After a slight\\r\\npreparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.  Mrs.\\r\\nBennet could hardly contain herself.  As soon as Jane had read\\r\\nMr. Gardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s  being soon married, her joy\\r\\nburst forth, and every following sentence added to its\\r\\nexuberance.  She was now in an irritation as violent from\\r\\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.\\r\\nTo know that her daughter would be married was enough.  She\\r\\nwas disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any\\r\\nremembrance of her misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried.  \"This is delightful indeed!\\r\\nShe will be married!  I shall see her again!  She will be married at\\r\\nsixteen!  My good, kind brother!  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nknew he would manage everything!  How I long to see her!  and\\r\\nto see dear Wickham too!  But the clothes, the wedding clothes!\\r\\nI will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.  Lizzy,\\r\\nmy dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will\\r\\ngive her.  Stay, stay, I will go myself.  Ring the bell, Kitty, for\\r\\nHill.  I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia!\\r\\nHow merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\\r\\nviolence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\\r\\nobligations which Mr. Gardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a\\r\\ngreat measure to his kindness.  We are persuaded that he has\\r\\npledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it\\r\\nbut her own uncle?  If he had not had a family of his own, I and\\r\\nmy children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\\r\\nfirst time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\\r\\npresents.  Well!  I am so happy!  In a short time I shall have a\\r\\ndaughter married.  Mrs. Wickham!  How well it sounds!  And\\r\\nshe was only sixteen last June.  My dear Jane, I am in such a\\r\\nflutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and you\\r\\nwrite for me.  We will settle with your father about the money\\r\\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,\\r\\nand cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very\\r\\nplentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty,\\r\\npersuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be\\r\\nconsulted.  One day\\'s delay, she observed, would be of small\\r\\nimportance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so\\r\\nobstinate as usual.  Other schemes, too, came into her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and\\r\\ntell the good, good news to my sister Philips.  And as I come\\r\\nback, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.  Kitty, run down\\r\\nand order the carriage.  An airing would do me a great deal of\\r\\ngood, I am sure.  Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?\\r\\nOh!  Here comes Hill!  My dear Hill, have you heard the good\\r\\nnews?  Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have\\r\\na bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.  Elizabeth received\\r\\nher congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly,\\r\\ntook refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it\\r\\nwas no worse, she had need to be thankful.  She felt it so; and\\r\\nthough, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\\r\\nworldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\\r\\nlooking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\\r\\nfelt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 50\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\\r\\nthat, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\\r\\nannual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\\r\\nwife, if she survived him.  He now wished it more than ever.\\r\\nHad he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\\r\\nindebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could\\r\\nnow be purchased for her.  The satisfaction of prevailing on one\\r\\nof the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her\\r\\nhusband might then have rested in its proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\\r\\nanyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\\r\\nbrother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\\r\\nthe extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\\r\\nsoon as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\\r\\nperfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.  The\\r\\nson was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be\\r\\nof age, and the widow and younger children would by that\\r\\nmeans be provided for.  Five daughters successively entered the\\r\\nworld, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many\\r\\nyears after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he would.  This\\r\\nevent had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\\r\\nsaving.  Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\\r\\nhusband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their\\r\\nexceeding their income.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\r\\nBennet and the children.  But in what proportions it should be\\r\\ndivided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\r\\nThis was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was\\r\\nnow to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\\r\\nacceding to the proposal before him.  In terms of grateful\\r\\nacknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\\r\\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\r\\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\\r\\nengagements that had been made for him.  He had never before\\r\\nsupposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\\r\\ndaughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\\r\\nhimself as by the present arrangement.  He would scarcely be\\r\\nten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid\\r\\nthem; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the\\r\\ncontinual presents in money which passed to her through her\\r\\nmother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expenses had been very little within\\r\\nthat sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\\r\\ntoo, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\\r\\nwas to have as little trouble in the business as possible.  When\\r\\nthe first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\\r\\nseeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\\r\\nindolence.  His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\\r\\nin undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.  He\\r\\nbegged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to\\r\\nhis brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message\\r\\nto her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with\\r\\nproportionate speed through the neighbourhood.  It was borne\\r\\nin the latter with decent philosophy.  To be sure, it would have\\r\\nbeen more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia\\r\\nBennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,\\r\\nbeen secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse.  But\\r\\nthere was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\\r\\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded\\r\\nbefore from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little\\r\\nof their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such\\r\\nan husband her misery was considered certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\\r\\nthis happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\\r\\nand in spirits oppressively high.  No sentiment of shame gave a\\r\\ndamp to her triumph.  The marriage of a daughter, which had\\r\\nbeen the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was\\r\\nnow on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her\\r\\nwords ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine\\r\\nmuslins, new carriages, and servants.  She was busily searching\\r\\nthrough the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her\\r\\ndaughter, and, without knowing of considering what their\\r\\nincome might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--\\r\\nor the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;\\r\\nbut Ashworth is too far off!  I could not bear to have her ten\\r\\nmiles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while\\r\\nthe servants remained.  But when they had withdrawn, he said\\r\\nto her: \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses\\r\\nfor your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.\\r\\nInto ONE house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\\r\\nadmittance.  I will not encourage the impudence of either, by\\r\\nreceiving them at Longbourn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\\r\\nfirm.  It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\\r\\namazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a\\r\\nguinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she\\r\\nshould receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the\\r\\noccasion.  Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.  That his\\r\\nanger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\\r\\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which\\r\\nher marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could\\r\\nbelieve possible.  She was more alive to the disgrace which her\\r\\nwant of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than\\r\\nto any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a\\r\\nfortnight before they took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\\r\\ndistress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\\r\\nwith their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would\\r\\nso shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they\\r\\nmight hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those\\r\\nwho were not immediately on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\\r\\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more\\r\\nconfidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one\\r\\nwhose knowledge of a sister\\'s frailty would have mortified her\\r\\nso much-- not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it\\r\\nindividually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf\\r\\nimpassable between them.  Had Lydia\\'s marriage been\\r\\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be\\r\\nsupposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family\\r\\nwhere, to every other objection, would now be added an\\r\\nalliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom\\r\\nhe so justly scorned.\\r\\n\\r\\n>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would\\r\\nshrink.  The wish of procuring her regard, which she had\\r\\nassured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational\\r\\nexpectation survive such a blow as this.  She was humbled, she\\r\\nwas grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.\\r\\nShe became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer\\r\\nhope to be benefited by it.  She wanted to hear of him, when\\r\\nthere seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.  She was\\r\\nconvinced that she could have been happy with him, when it\\r\\nwas no longer likely they should meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know\\r\\nthat the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four\\r\\nmonths ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully\\r\\nreceived!  He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most\\r\\ngenerous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a\\r\\ntriumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man\\r\\nwho, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have\\r\\nanswered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to\\r\\nthe advantage of both: by her ease and liveliness, his mind might\\r\\nhave been softened, his manners improved; and from his\\r\\njudgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\\r\\nhave received benefit of greater importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring\\r\\nmultitude what connubial felicity really was.  An union of a\\r\\ndifferent tendency ,and precluding the possibility of the other,\\r\\nwas soon to be formed in their family.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\\r\\nindependence, she could not imagine.  But how little of\\r\\npermanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only\\r\\nbrought together because their passions were stronger than their\\r\\nvirtue, she could easily conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.  To Mr. Bennet\\'s\\r\\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\\r\\neagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\\r\\nconcluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\\r\\nmentioned to him again.  The principal purport of his letter was\\r\\nto inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\\r\\nmilitia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added, \"as\\r\\nsoon as his marriage was fixed on.  And I think you will agree\\r\\nwith me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly\\r\\nadvisable, both on his account and my niece\\'s.  It is Mr.\\r\\nWickham\\'s intention to go into the regulars; and among his\\r\\nformer friends, there are still some who are able and willing to\\r\\nassist him in the army.  He has the promise of an ensigncy in\\r\\nGeneral ----\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North.  It is an\\r\\nadvantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.  He\\r\\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they\\r\\nmay each have a character to preserve, they will both be more\\r\\nprudent.  I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our\\r\\npresent arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the\\r\\nvarious creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with\\r\\nassurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.\\r\\nAnd will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar\\r\\nassurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a\\r\\nlist according to his information?  He has given in all his debts; I\\r\\nhope at least he has not deceived us.  Haggerston has our\\r\\ndirections, and all will be completed in a week.  They will then\\r\\njoin his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and\\r\\nI understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous\\r\\nof seeing you all before she leaves the South.  She is well, and\\r\\nbegs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.--\\r\\nYours, etc.,\\r\\n                         \"E. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of\\r\\nWickham\\'s removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr.\\r\\nGardiner could do.  But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased\\r\\nwith it.  Lydia\\'s being settled in the North, just when she had\\r\\nexpected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had\\r\\nby no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire,\\r\\nwas a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity\\r\\nthat Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was\\r\\nacquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster, \"said she, \"it will be quite\\r\\nshocking to send her away!  And there are several of the young\\r\\nmen, too, that she likes very much.  The officers may not be so\\r\\npleasant in General ----\\'s regiment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\r\\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\r\\nreceived at first an absolute negative.  But Jane and Elizabeth,\\r\\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and\\r\\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her\\r\\nparents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly,\\r\\nto receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they\\r\\nwere married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought,\\r\\nand act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction\\r\\nof knowing that she would be able to show her married\\r\\ndaughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\\r\\nNorth.  When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,\\r\\nhe sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that\\r\\nas soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to\\r\\nLongbourn.  Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham\\r\\nshould consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only\\r\\nher own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the\\r\\nlast object of her wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 51\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEIR sister\\'s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\\r\\nfor her probably more than she felt for herself.  The carriage\\r\\nwas sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by\\r\\ndinner-time.  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss\\r\\nBennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings\\r\\nwhich would have attended herself, had she been the culprit,\\r\\nand was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came.  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\\r\\nreceive them.  Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\\r\\ncarriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\\r\\ngrave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\\r\\nopen, and she ran into the room.  Her mother stepped forwards,\\r\\nembraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand,\\r\\nwith an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady;\\r\\nand wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt\\r\\nof their happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned,\\r\\nwas not quite so cordial.  His countenance rather gained in\\r\\nausterity; and he scarcely opened his lips.  The easy\\r\\nassurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke\\r\\nhim.  Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was\\r\\nshocked.  Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild,\\r\\nnoisy, and fearless.  She turned from sister to sister,\\r\\ndemanding their congratulations; and when at length they all\\r\\nsat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some\\r\\nlittle alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it\\r\\nwas a great while since she had been there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\\r\\nmanners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\\r\\nmarriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\\r\\naddress, while he claimed their relationship, would have\\r\\ndelighted them all.  Elizabeth had not before believed him\\r\\nquite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving\\r\\nwithin herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of\\r\\nan impudent man.  She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\\r\\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no\\r\\nvariation of colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no want of discourse.  The bride and her mother could\\r\\nneither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\\r\\nsit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in\\r\\nthat neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt\\r\\nvery unable to equal in her replies.  They seemed each of them\\r\\nto have the happiest memories in the world.  Nothing of the\\r\\npast was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to\\r\\nsubjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I\\r\\nwent away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there\\r\\nhave been things enough happened in the time.  Good gracious!\\r\\nwhen I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married\\r\\ntill I came back again!  though I thought it would be very good\\r\\nfun if I was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father lifted up his eyes.  Jane was distressed.  Elizabeth\\r\\nlooked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\\r\\nany thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\\r\\n\"Oh!  mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married\\r\\nto-day?  I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William\\r\\nGoulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know\\r\\nit, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off\\r\\nmy glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so\\r\\nthat he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\\r\\nany thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer.  She got up, and ran out of\\r\\nthe room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing\\r\\nthrough the hall to the dining parlour.  She then joined them\\r\\nsoon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her\\r\\nmother\\'s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,\\r\\n\"Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower,\\r\\nbecause I am a married woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\\r\\nembarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\r\\nHer ease and good spirits increased.  She longed to see Mrs.\\r\\nPhillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\\r\\nhear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\" by each of them; and in the\\r\\nmean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring, and boast of\\r\\nbeing married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to the\\r\\nbreakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband?  Is not\\r\\nhe a charming man?  I am sure my sisters must all envy me.  I\\r\\nonly hope they may have half my good luck.  They must all go to\\r\\nBrighton.  That is the place to get husbands.  What a pity it\\r\\nis, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.  But my dear\\r\\nLydia, I don\\'t at all like your going such a way off.  Must it\\r\\nbe so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  yes; -- there is nothing in that.  I shall like it\\r\\nof all things.  You and papa, and my sisters, must come down\\r\\nand see us.  We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I\\r\\ndare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get\\r\\ngood partners for them all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\\r\\nsisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for\\r\\nthem before the winter is over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth;\\r\\n\"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.\\r\\nMr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London,\\r\\nand he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\\r\\nshort; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\\r\\nher daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These\\r\\nparties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was\\r\\neven more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\\r\\nexpected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him.  She had\\r\\nscarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from\\r\\nthe reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on\\r\\nby the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would\\r\\nhave wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose\\r\\nto elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his\\r\\nflight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\\r\\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an\\r\\nopportunity of having a companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him.  He was her dear Wickham on\\r\\nevery occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.\\r\\nHe did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would\\r\\nkill more birds on the first of September, than any body else\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\\r\\nher two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe.\\r\\nYou were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\r\\nAre not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too\\r\\nlittle said on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!  You are so strange!  But I must tell you how it went off.\\r\\nWe were married, you know, at St. Clement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s\\r\\nlodgings were in that parish.  And it was settled that we\\r\\nshould all be there by eleven o\\'clock.  My uncle and aunt and I\\r\\nwere to go together; and the others were to meet us at the\\r\\nchurch.  Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!\\r\\nI was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put\\r\\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.  And\\r\\nthere was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and\\r\\ntalking away just as if she was reading a sermon.  However, I\\r\\ndid not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may\\r\\nsuppose, of my dear Wickham.  I longed to know whether he would\\r\\nbe married in his blue coat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it\\r\\nwould never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,\\r\\nthat my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I\\r\\nwas with them.  If you\\'ll believe me, I did not once put my\\r\\nfoot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.  Not one\\r\\nparty, or scheme, or any thing.  To be sure London was rather\\r\\nthin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.  Well, and so\\r\\njust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away\\r\\nupon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  And then, you\\r\\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it.\\r\\nWell, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my\\r\\nuncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we\\r\\ncould not be married all day.  But, luckily, he came back again\\r\\nin ten minutes\\' time, and then we all set out.  However, I\\r\\nrecollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going,\\r\\nthe wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done\\r\\nas well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes! -- he was to come there with Wickham, you know, But\\r\\ngracious me!  I quite forgot!  I ought not to have said a word\\r\\nabout it.  I promised them so faithfully!  What will Wickham\\r\\nsay?  It was to be such a secret!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on\\r\\nthe subject.  You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with\\r\\ncuriosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly\\r\\ntell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it\\r\\nout of her power, by running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\\r\\nleast it was impossible not to try for information.  Mr. Darcy\\r\\nhad been at her sister\\'s wedding.  It was exactly a scene, and\\r\\nexactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and\\r\\nleast temptation to go.  Conjectures as to the meaning of it,\\r\\nrapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied\\r\\nwith none.  Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct\\r\\nin the noblest light, seemed most improbable.  She could not\\r\\nbear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote\\r\\na short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\\r\\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which\\r\\nhad been intended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity\\r\\nmust be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\\r\\n(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\\r\\nbeen amongst you at such a time.  Pray write instantly, and let\\r\\nme understand it -- unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to\\r\\nremain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and\\r\\nthen I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not that I shall, though,\" she added to herself, as she\\r\\nfinished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me\\r\\nin an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks\\r\\nand stratagems to find it out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\r\\nElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\\r\\nglad of it; -- till it appeared whether her inquiries would\\r\\nreceive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a\\r\\nconfidante.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 52\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\\r\\nletter as soon as she possibly could.  She was no sooner in\\r\\npossession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where\\r\\nshe was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of\\r\\nthe benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the\\r\\nletter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nMY DEAR NIECE,\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\r\\nmorning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing\\r\\nwill not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must confess\\r\\nmyself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from\\r\\nyou.  Don\\'t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let\\r\\nyou know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary\\r\\non your side.  If you do not choose to understand me, forgive\\r\\nmy impertinence.  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am --\\r\\nand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\\r\\nwould have allowed him to act as he has done.  But if you are\\r\\nreally innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.  On the\\r\\nvery day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a\\r\\nmost unexpected visitor.  Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up\\r\\nwith him several hours.  It was all over before I arrived; so\\r\\nmy curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your\\'s seems to\\r\\nhave been.  He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out\\r\\nwhere your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen\\r\\nand talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\\r\\nFrom what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\\r\\nourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\\r\\nthem.  The motive professed was his conviction of its being\\r\\nowing to himself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so\\r\\nwell known as to make it impossible for any young woman of\\r\\ncharacter to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed the\\r\\nwhole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before\\r\\nthought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the\\r\\nworld.  His character was to speak for itself.  He called it,\\r\\ntherefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an\\r\\nevil which had been brought on by himself.  If he had\\r\\nanother motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.  He\\r\\nhad been some days in town, before he was able to discover\\r\\nthem; but he had something to direct his search, which was more\\r\\nthan we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason\\r\\nfor his resolving to follow us.  There is a lady, it seems, a\\r\\nMrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and\\r\\nwas dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation,\\r\\nthough he did not say what.  She then took a large house in\\r\\nEdward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\\r\\nlodgings.  This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted\\r\\nwith Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as\\r\\nsoon as he got to town.  But it was two or three days before he\\r\\ncould get from her what he wanted.  She would not betray her\\r\\ntrust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she\\r\\nreally did know where her friend was to be found.  Wickham\\r\\nindeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and\\r\\nhad she been able to receive them into her house, they would\\r\\nhave taken up their abode with her.  At length, however, our\\r\\nkind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They were in\\r\\n---- street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing\\r\\nLydia.  His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to\\r\\npersuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and\\r\\nreturn to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to\\r\\nreceive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.\\r\\nBut he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she\\r\\nwas.  She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of\\r\\nhis; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.  She was sure they\\r\\nshould be married some time or other, and it did not much\\r\\nsignify when.  Since such were her feelings, it only remained,\\r\\nhe thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his\\r\\nvery first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had\\r\\nnever been his design.  He confessed himself obliged to leave\\r\\nthe regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were\\r\\nvery pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences\\r\\nof Lydia\\'s flight on her own folly alone.  He meant to resign\\r\\nhis commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he\\r\\ncould conjecture very little about it.  He must go somewhere,\\r\\nbut he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing\\r\\nto live on.  Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\\r\\nsister at once.  Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very\\r\\nrich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his\\r\\nsituation must have been benefited by marriage.  But he found,\\r\\nin reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the\\r\\nhope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some\\r\\nother country.  Under such circumstances, however, he was not\\r\\nlikely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\r\\nThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\r\\nWickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\\r\\nwas reduced to be reasonable.  Every thing being settled\\r\\nbetween them, Mr. Darcy\\'s next step was to make your uncle\\r\\nacquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street\\r\\nthe evening before I came home.  But Mr. Gardiner could not be\\r\\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father\\r\\nwas still with him, but would quit town the next morning.  He\\r\\ndid not judge your father to be a person whom he could so\\r\\nproperly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\\r\\nseeing him till after the departure of the former.  He did not\\r\\nleave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a\\r\\ngentleman had called on business.  On Saturday he came again.\\r\\nYour father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said\\r\\nbefore, they had a great deal of talk together.  They met again\\r\\non Sunday, and then I saw him too.  It was not all settled\\r\\nbefore Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\\r\\nLongbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.  I fancy,\\r\\nLizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\r\\nafter all.  He has been accused of many faults at different\\r\\ntimes, but this is the true one.  Nothing was to be done that\\r\\nhe did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it\\r\\nto be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle\\r\\nwould most readily have settled the whole.  They battled it\\r\\ntogether for a long time, which was more than either the\\r\\ngentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.  But at last your\\r\\nuncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be\\r\\nof use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the\\r\\nprobable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and\\r\\nI really believe your letter this morning gave him great\\r\\npleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him\\r\\nof his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\r\\nBut, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at\\r\\nmost.  You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for\\r\\nthe young people.  His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\\r\\nbelieve, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\\r\\nthousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his\\r\\ncommission purchased.  The reason why all this was to be done\\r\\nby him alone, was such as I have given above.  It was owing to\\r\\nhim, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\\r\\nWickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently\\r\\nthat he had been received and noticed as he was.  Perhaps there\\r\\nwas some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve,\\r\\nor anybody\\'s reserve, can be answerable for the event.  But\\r\\nin spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest\\r\\nperfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if\\r\\nwe had not given him credit for another interest in the\\r\\naffair.  When all this was resolved on, he returned again to\\r\\nhis friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was\\r\\nagreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding\\r\\ntook place, and all money matters were then to receive the last\\r\\nfinish.  I believe I have now told you every thing.  It is a\\r\\nrelation which you tell me is to give you great surprise;\\r\\nI hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.\\r\\nLydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the\\r\\nhouse.  He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in\\r\\nHertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\\r\\nsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I\\r\\nhad not perceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her\\r\\nconduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and\\r\\ntherefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.\\r\\nI talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\\r\\nrepresenting to her all the wickedness of what she had done,\\r\\nand all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.  If she\\r\\nheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not\\r\\nlisten.  I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected\\r\\nmy dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience\\r\\nwith her.  Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia\\r\\ninformed you, attended the wedding.  He dined with us the next\\r\\nday, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.\\r\\nWill you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this\\r\\nopportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say\\r\\nbefore) how much I like him.  His behaviour to us has, in every\\r\\nrespect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.  His\\r\\nunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\\r\\na little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently,\\r\\nhis wife may teach him.  I thought him very sly; -- he hardly\\r\\never mentioned your name.  But slyness seems the fashion.  Pray\\r\\nforgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\\r\\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P.  I shall never be\\r\\nquite happy till I have been all round the park.  A low\\r\\nphaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very\\r\\nthing.  But I must write no more.  The children have been\\r\\nwanting me this half hour.  Your\\'s, very sincerely,\\r\\n\\r\\nM. GARDINER.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter\\r\\nof spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether\\r\\npleasure or pain bore the greatest share.  The vague and\\r\\nunsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what\\r\\nMr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s match,\\r\\nwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness\\r\\ntoo great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\\r\\njust, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their\\r\\ngreatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to\\r\\ntown, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification\\r\\nattendant on such a research; in which supplication had been\\r\\nnecessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and\\r\\nwhere he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,\\r\\npersuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished\\r\\nto avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\\r\\npronounce.  He had done all this for a girl whom he could\\r\\nneither regard nor esteem.  Her heart did whisper that he had\\r\\ndone it for her.  But it was a hope shortly checked by other\\r\\nconsiderations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was\\r\\ninsufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her\\r\\n-- for a woman who had already refused him -- as able to\\r\\novercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against\\r\\nrelationship with Wickham.  Brother-in-law of Wickham!  Every\\r\\nkind of pride must revolt from the connection.  He had, to be\\r\\nsure, done much.  She was ashamed to think how much.  But he\\r\\nhad given a reason for his interference, which asked no\\r\\nextraordinary stretch of belief.  It was reasonable that he\\r\\nshould feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had\\r\\nthe means of exercising it; and though she would not place\\r\\nherself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps,\\r\\nbelieve that remaining partiality for her might assist his\\r\\nendeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\\r\\nmaterially concerned.  It was painful, exceedingly painful, to\\r\\nknow that they were under obligations to a person who could\\r\\nnever receive a return.  They owed the restoration of Lydia,\\r\\nher character, every thing, to him.  Oh!  how heartily did she\\r\\ngrieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,\\r\\nevery saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.  For\\r\\nherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.  Proud that\\r\\nin a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\\r\\nthe better of himself.  She read over her aunt\\'s commendation\\r\\nof him again and again.  It was hardly enough; but it pleased\\r\\nher.  She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with\\r\\nregret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had\\r\\nbeen persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between\\r\\nMr. Darcy and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some\\r\\none\\'s approach; and before she could strike into another path,\\r\\nshe was overtaken by Wickham.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\"\\r\\nsaid he, as he joined her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does not\\r\\nfollow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.  We were always good\\r\\nfriends; and now we are better.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  Are the others coming out?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not know.  Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the\\r\\ncarriage to Meryton.  And so, my dear sister, I find, from\\r\\nour uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would\\r\\nbe too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to\\r\\nNewcastle.  And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?  Poor\\r\\nReynolds, she was always very fond of me.  But of course she\\r\\ndid not mention my name to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\\r\\n-- not turned out well.  At such a distance as that, you\\r\\nknow, things are strangely misrepresented.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips.  Elizabeth hoped she\\r\\nhad silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.  We passed\\r\\neach other several times.  I wonder what he can be doing\\r\\nthere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"It must be something particular, to take him there\\r\\nat this time of year.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly.  Did you see him while you were at Lambton?\\r\\nI thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\\r\\nthis year or two.  When I last saw her, she was not very\\r\\npromising.  I am very glad you liked her.  I hope she will turn\\r\\nout well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\\r\\nhad.  A most delightful place! -- Excellent Parsonage House!\\r\\nIt would have suited me in every respect.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceedingly well.  I should have considered it as part of my\\r\\nduty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.  One ought\\r\\nnot to repine; -- but, to be sure, it would have been such a\\r\\nthing for me!  The quiet, the retirement of such a life would\\r\\nhave answered all my ideas of happiness!  But it was not to be.\\r\\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were\\r\\nin Kent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good,\\r\\nthat it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\\r\\npresent patron.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have.  Yes, there was something in that; I told you so\\r\\nfrom the first, you may remember.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making\\r\\nwas not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that\\r\\nyou actually declared your resolution of never taking orders,\\r\\nand that the business had been compromised accordingly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You did!  and it was not wholly without foundation.  You may\\r\\nremember what I told you on that point, when first we talked\\r\\nof it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she\\r\\nhad walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her\\r\\nsister\\'s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with\\r\\na good-humoured smile,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.\\r\\nDo not let us quarrel about the past.  In future, I hope we\\r\\nshall be always of one mind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate\\r\\ngallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they\\r\\nentered the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 53\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation\\r\\nthat he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear\\r\\nsister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was\\r\\npleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nwas forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by\\r\\nno means entered into her scheme of their all going to\\r\\nNewcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, lord!  I don\\'t know.  Not these two or three years,\\r\\nperhaps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As often as I can.  But you know married women have never much\\r\\ntime for writing.  My sisters may write to me.  They will\\r\\nhave nothing else to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his\\r\\nwife\\'s.  He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were\\r\\nout of the house, \"as ever I saw.  He simpers, and smirks, and\\r\\nmakes love to us all.  I am prodigiously proud of him.  I defy\\r\\neven Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable\\r\\nson-in-law.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for\\r\\nseveral days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as\\r\\nparting with one\\'s friends.  One seems so forlorn without\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying\\r\\na daughter,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It must make you better\\r\\nsatisfied that your other four are single.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is no such thing.  Lydia does not leave me because she is\\r\\nmarried, but only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be\\r\\nso far off.  If that had been nearer, she would not have gone\\r\\nso soon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into\\r\\nwas shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the\\r\\nagitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be\\r\\nin circulation.  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received\\r\\norders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming\\r\\ndown in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.  She looked at Jane, and\\r\\nsmiled and shook her head by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\"\\r\\n(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news).  \"Well, so\\r\\nmuch the better.  Not that I care about it, though.  He is\\r\\nnothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to\\r\\nsee him again.  But, however, he is very welcome to come to\\r\\nNetherfield, if he likes it.  And who knows what may\\r\\nhappen?  But that is nothing to us.  You know, sister, we\\r\\nagreed long ago never to mention a word about it.  And so,\\r\\nis it quite certain he is coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls\\r\\nwas in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out\\r\\nmyself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that\\r\\nit was certain true.  He comes down on Thursday at the latest,\\r\\nvery likely on Wednesday.  She was going to the butcher\\'s, she\\r\\ntold me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she\\r\\nhas got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without\\r\\nchanging colour.  It was many months since she had mentioned\\r\\nhis name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone\\r\\ntogether, she said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of\\r\\nthe present report; and I know I appeared distressed.  But\\r\\ndon\\'t imagine it was from any silly cause.  I was only confused\\r\\nfor the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at.\\r\\nI do assure you that the news does not affect me either with\\r\\npleasure or pain.  I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone;\\r\\nbecause we shall see the less of him.  Not that I am afraid of\\r\\nmyself, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it.  Had she not seen\\r\\nhim in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of\\r\\ncoming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but\\r\\nshe still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to\\r\\nthe greater probability of his coming there with his friend\\'s\\r\\npermission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man\\r\\ncannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without\\r\\nraising all this speculation!  I will leave him to himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be\\r\\nher feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could\\r\\neasily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.  They\\r\\nwere more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\\r\\nparents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"you will wait on him of course.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no.  You forced me into visiting him last year, and\\r\\npromised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my\\r\\ndaughters.  But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on\\r\\na fool\\'s errand again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an\\r\\nattention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his\\r\\nreturning to Netherfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he.  \"If he wants our\\r\\nsociety, let him seek it.  He knows where we live.  I will not\\r\\nspend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they\\r\\ngo away and come back again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do\\r\\nnot wait on him.  But, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking\\r\\nhim to dine here, I am determined.  We must have Mrs. Long and\\r\\nthe Gouldings soon.  That will make thirteen with ourselves, so\\r\\nthere will be just room at table for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear\\r\\nher husband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know\\r\\nthat her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence\\r\\nof it, before they did.  As the day of his arrival drew near,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her\\r\\nsister.  \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\\r\\nindifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\\r\\ntalked of.  My mother means well; but she does not know, no one\\r\\ncan know, how much I suffer from what she says.  Happy shall I\\r\\nbe, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,\" replied\\r\\nElizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power.  You must feel\\r\\nit; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a\\r\\nsufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley arrived.  Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of\\r\\nservants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that\\r\\nthe period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as\\r\\nlong as it could.  She counted the days that must intervene\\r\\nbefore their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him\\r\\nbefore.  But on the third morning after his arrival in\\r\\nHertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\\r\\nenter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.  Jane\\r\\nresolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to\\r\\nsatisfy her mother, went to the window -- she looked, -- she\\r\\nsaw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it\\r\\nbe?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I\\r\\ndo not know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to\\r\\nbe with him before.  Mr. what\\'s-his-name.  That tall, proud\\r\\nman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Mr. Darcy! -- and so it does, I vow.  Well,\\r\\nany friend of Mr. Bingley\\'s will always be welcome here, to be\\r\\nsure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.  She knew\\r\\nbut little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt\\r\\nfor the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him\\r\\nalmost for the first time after receiving his explanatory\\r\\nletter.  Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.  Each felt for\\r\\nthe other, and of course for themselves; and their mother\\r\\ntalked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to\\r\\nbe civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\\'s friend, without being\\r\\nheard by either of them.  But Elizabeth had sources of\\r\\nuneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she\\r\\nhad never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\\'s letter, or to\\r\\nrelate her own change of sentiment towards him.  To Jane, he\\r\\ncould be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose\\r\\nmerit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\\r\\ninformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were\\r\\nindebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded\\r\\nherself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as\\r\\nreasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.  Her\\r\\nastonishment at his coming -- at his coming to Netherfield, to\\r\\nLongbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal\\r\\nto what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour\\r\\nin Derbyshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for\\r\\nhalf a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight\\r\\nadded lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time\\r\\nthat his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.  But she\\r\\nwould not be secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be\\r\\nearly enough for expectation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without\\r\\ndaring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them\\r\\nto the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the\\r\\ndoor.  Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate\\r\\nthan Elizabeth had expected.  On the gentlemen\\'s appearing, her\\r\\ncolour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease,\\r\\nand with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom\\r\\nof resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and\\r\\nsat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\\r\\noften command.  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.  He\\r\\nlooked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been\\r\\nused to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at\\r\\nPemberley.  But, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s presence\\r\\nbe what he was before her uncle and aunt.  It was a painful,\\r\\nbut not an improbable, conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that\\r\\nshort period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.  He\\r\\nwas received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which\\r\\nmade her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with\\r\\nthe cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address\\r\\nto his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the\\r\\nlatter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\\r\\nirremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\\r\\ndegree by a distinction so ill applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a\\r\\nquestion which she could not answer without confusion, said\\r\\nscarcely any thing.  He was not seated by her; perhaps that was\\r\\nthe reason of his silence; but it had not been so in\\r\\nDerbyshire.  There he had talked to her friends, when he could\\r\\nnot to herself.  But now several minutes elapsed without\\r\\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable\\r\\nto resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his\\r\\nface, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and\\r\\nfrequently on no object but the ground.  More thoughtfulness\\r\\nand less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were\\r\\nplainly expressed.  She was disappointed, and angry with\\r\\nherself for being so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she.  \"Yet why did\\r\\nhe come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself;\\r\\nand to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe readily agreed to it.  \"I began to be afraid you would never come back\\r\\nagain.  People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;\\r\\nbut, however, I hope it is not true.  A great many changes have\\r\\nhappened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.  Miss Lucas\\r\\nis married and settled.  And one of my own daughters.\\r\\nI suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen\\r\\nit in the papers.  It was in The Times and The Courier, I\\r\\nknow; though it was not put in as it ought to be.  It was only\\r\\nsaid, ``Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\\'\\'\\r\\nwithout there being a syllable said of her father, or the place\\r\\nwhere she lived, or any thing.  It was my brother Gardiner\\'s\\r\\ndrawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an\\r\\nawkward business of it.  Did you see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\r\\nElizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.  How Mr. Darcy looked,\\r\\ntherefore, she could not tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter\\r\\nwell married,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time,\\r\\nMr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from\\r\\nme.  They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward,\\r\\nit seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long.\\r\\nHis regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his\\r\\nleaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.\\r\\nThank Heaven!  he has some friends, though perhaps not so\\r\\nmany as he deserves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was\\r\\nin such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\\r\\nIt drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which\\r\\nnothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked\\r\\nBingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at\\r\\npresent.  A few weeks, he believed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\"\\r\\nsaid her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as\\r\\nmany as you please on Mr. Bennet\\'s manor.  I am sure he\\r\\nwill be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the\\r\\nbest of the covies for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such\\r\\nofficious attention!  Were the same fair prospect to arise at\\r\\npresent as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was\\r\\npersuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.\\r\\nAt that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not\\r\\nmake Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful\\r\\nconfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never\\r\\nmore to be in company with either of them.  Their society can\\r\\nafford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as\\r\\nthis!  Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\r\\ncompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from\\r\\nobserving how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the\\r\\nadmiration of her former lover.  When first he came in, he had\\r\\nspoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be\\r\\ngiving her more of his attention.  He found her as handsome as\\r\\nshe had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,\\r\\nthough not quite so chatty.  Jane was anxious that no\\r\\ndifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really\\r\\npersuaded that she talked as much as ever.  But her mind was\\r\\nso busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\\r\\nher intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to\\r\\ndine at Longbourn in a few days time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added,\\r\\n\"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take\\r\\na family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.  I have not\\r\\nforgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed\\r\\nthat you did not come back and keep your engagement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\\r\\nsomething of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\r\\nThey then went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and\\r\\ndine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good\\r\\ntable, she did not think any thing less than two courses could\\r\\nbe good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs,\\r\\nor satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 54\\r\\n\\r\\nAS soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover\\r\\nher spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption\\r\\non those subjects that must deaden them more.  Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\nbehaviour astonished and vexed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\"\\r\\nsaid she, \"did he come at all?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and\\r\\naunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?  If he fears me,\\r\\nwhy come hither?  If he no longer cares for me, why silent?\\r\\nTeazing, teazing, man!  I will think no more about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by\\r\\nthe approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful\\r\\nlook, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors,\\r\\nthan Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel\\r\\nperfectly easy.  I know my own strength, and I shall never be\\r\\nembarrassed again by his coming.  I am glad he dines here on\\r\\nTuesday.  It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides,\\r\\nwe meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly.\\r\\n\"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\\r\\nnow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much\\r\\nin love with you as ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the\\r\\nhappy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness\\r\\nof Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had revived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn;\\r\\nand the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of\\r\\ntheir punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.  When\\r\\nthey repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to\\r\\nsee whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their\\r\\nformer parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.  Her\\r\\nprudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite\\r\\nhim to sit by herself.  On entering the room, he seemed to\\r\\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to\\r\\nsmile: it was decided.  He placed himself by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\\r\\nfriend.  He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\\r\\nimagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,\\r\\nhad she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nwith an expression of half-laughing alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\\r\\nshewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\\r\\nformerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\\r\\nJane\\'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.\\r\\nThough she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet\\r\\nreceived pleasure from observing his behaviour.  It gave her\\r\\nall the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\\r\\nno cheerful humour.  Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as\\r\\nthe table could divide them.  He was on one side of her mother.\\r\\nShe knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to\\r\\neither, or make either appear to advantage.  She was not near\\r\\nenough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how\\r\\nseldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was\\r\\ntheir manner whenever they did.  Her mother\\'s ungraciousness,\\r\\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind; and she would, at times, have given any\\r\\nthing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was\\r\\nneither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\\r\\nof bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would\\r\\nnot pass away without enabling them to enter into something\\r\\nmore of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation\\r\\nattending his entrance.  Anxious and uneasy, the period which\\r\\npassed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was\\r\\nwearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\\r\\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\\r\\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he does not come to me, then,\" said she, \"I shall give\\r\\nhim up for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would\\r\\nhave answered her hopes; but, alas!  the ladies had crowded\\r\\nround the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and\\r\\nElizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy\\r\\nthat there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit\\r\\nof a chair.  And on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of the\\r\\ngirls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined.  We want\\r\\nnone of them; do we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room.  She\\r\\nfollowed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke,\\r\\nhad scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and\\r\\nthen was enraged against herself for being so silly!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who has once been refused!  How could I ever be foolish\\r\\nenough to expect a renewal of his love?  Is there one among the\\r\\nsex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\\r\\nproposal to the same woman?  There is no indignity so abhorrent\\r\\nto their feelings!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\\r\\ncoffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And quite alone?  Have all her friends left her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her.  The others have been gone on to\\r\\nScarborough, these three weeks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\\r\\nconverse with her, he might have better success.  He stood by\\r\\nher, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on\\r\\nthe young lady\\'s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed,\\r\\nthe ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon\\r\\njoined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him\\r\\nfall a victim to her mother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and\\r\\nin a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.  She\\r\\nnow lost every expectation of pleasure.  They were confined for\\r\\nthe evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope,\\r\\nbut that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the\\r\\nroom, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen\\r\\nto supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any\\r\\nof the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to\\r\\nthemselves, \"What say you to the day?  I think every thing has\\r\\npassed off uncommonly well, I assure you.  The dinner was as\\r\\nwell dressed as any I ever saw.  The venison was roasted to a\\r\\nturn -- and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.  The\\r\\nsoup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases\\'\\r\\nlast week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\\r\\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three\\r\\nFrench cooks at least.  And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look\\r\\nin greater beauty.  Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her\\r\\nwhether you did not.  And what do you think she said besides?\\r\\n``Ah!  Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\\'\\'\\r\\nShe did indeed.  I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as\\r\\never lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and\\r\\nnot at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\\r\\nenough of Bingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\\r\\nwould get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\\r\\nfamily, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\\r\\nshe was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the\\r\\nnext day, to make his proposals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to\\r\\nElizabeth.  \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable\\r\\none with the other.  I hope we may often meet again.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so.  You must not suspect me.  It\\r\\nmortifies me.  I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy\\r\\nhis conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man,\\r\\nwithout having a wish beyond it.  I am perfectly satisfied,\\r\\nfrom what his manners now are, that he never had any design\\r\\nof engaging my affection.  It is only that he is blessed\\r\\nwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of\\r\\ngenerally pleasing, than any other man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me\\r\\nsmile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\r\\nacknowledge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.  We all\\r\\nlove to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\\r\\nknowing.  Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do\\r\\nnot make me your confidante.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 55\\r\\n\\r\\nA FEW days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and\\r\\nalone.  His friend had left him that morning for London, but\\r\\nwas to return home in ten days time.  He sat with them above an\\r\\nhour, and was in remarkably good spirits.  Mrs. Bennet invited\\r\\nhim to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern,\\r\\nhe confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more\\r\\nlucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if\\r\\nshe would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of\\r\\nwaiting on them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her\\r\\ninvitation was accepted with alacrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none\\r\\nof them dressed.  In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\\'s room, in\\r\\nher dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.  He is come --\\r\\nMr. Bingley is come. -- He is, indeed.  Make haste, make haste.\\r\\nHere, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on\\r\\nwith her gown.  Never mind Miss Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say\\r\\nKitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs\\r\\nhalf an hour ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  hang Kitty!  what has she to do with it?  Come be quick,\\r\\nbe quick!  Where is your sash, my dear?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\\r\\ngo down without one of her sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again\\r\\nin the evening.  After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library,\\r\\nas was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.\\r\\nTwo obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a\\r\\nconsiderable time, without making any impression on them.\\r\\nElizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did,\\r\\nshe very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma?  What do\\r\\nyou keep winking at me for?  What am I to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing child, nothing.  I did not wink at you.\"  She then sat\\r\\nstill five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious\\r\\noccasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here,\\r\\nmy love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room.\\r\\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her\\r\\ndistress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she\\r\\nwould not give in to it.  In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nhalf-opened the door and called out,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her\\r\\nmother, as soon as she was in the hall.  \"Kitty and I are going\\r\\nup stairs to sit in my dressing room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but\\r\\nremained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of\\r\\nsight, then returned into the drawing room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley\\r\\nwas every thing that was charming, except the professed lover\\r\\nof her daughter.  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a\\r\\nmost agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore\\r\\nwith the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all\\r\\nher silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance\\r\\nparticularly grateful to the daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he\\r\\nwent away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own\\r\\nand Mrs. Bennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot\\r\\nwith her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.\\r\\nNot a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but\\r\\nElizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must\\r\\nspeedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the\\r\\nstated time.  Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded\\r\\nthat all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s\\r\\nconcurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\\r\\nspent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter\\r\\nwas much more agreeable than his companion expected.  There was\\r\\nnothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke\\r\\nhis ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more\\r\\ncommunicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen\\r\\nhim.  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the\\r\\nevening Mrs. Bennet\\'s invention was again at work to get every\\r\\nbody away from him and her daughter.  Elizabeth, who had a\\r\\nletter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose\\r\\nsoon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to\\r\\ncards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\'s\\r\\nschemes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was\\r\\nfinished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was\\r\\nreason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for\\r\\nher.  On opening the door, she perceived her sister and\\r\\nBingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\\r\\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the\\r\\nfaces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away\\r\\nfrom each other, would have told it all.  Their situation\\r\\nwas awkward enough; but her\\'s she thought was still worse.\\r\\nNot a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on\\r\\nthe point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as\\r\\nthe other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\\r\\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence\\r\\nwould give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,\\r\\nwith the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature\\r\\nin the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much.  I do not\\r\\ndeserve it.  Oh!  why is not every body as happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\\r\\nwarmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.  Every\\r\\nsentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.\\r\\nBut she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say\\r\\nhalf that remained to be said for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried.  \"I would not on\\r\\nany account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow\\r\\nher to hear it from any one but myself.  He is gone to my\\r\\nfather already.  Oh!  Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate\\r\\nwill give such pleasure to all my dear family!  how shall I\\r\\nbear so much happiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken\\r\\nup the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity\\r\\nand ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had\\r\\ngiven them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious\\r\\ncircumspection!  of all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance!\\r\\nthe happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference\\r\\nwith her father had been short and to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With my mother up stairs.  She will be down in a moment,\\r\\nI dare say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\\r\\nwishes and affection of a sister.  Elizabeth honestly and\\r\\nheartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their\\r\\nrelationship.  They shook hands with great cordiality; and\\r\\nthen, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he\\r\\nhad to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections;\\r\\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed\\r\\nall his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded,\\r\\nbecause they had for basis the excellent understanding, and\\r\\nsuper-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity\\r\\nof feeling and taste between her and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the\\r\\nsatisfaction of Miss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet\\r\\nanimation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\r\\nKitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\r\\nMrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation\\r\\nin terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked\\r\\nto Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr.\\r\\nBennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly\\r\\nshewed how really happy he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till\\r\\ntheir visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he\\r\\nwas gone, he turned to his daughter, and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jane, I congratulate you.  You will be a very happy woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\r\\ngoodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure\\r\\nin thinking you will be so happily settled.  I have not a doubt\\r\\nof your doing very well together.  Your tempers are by no means\\r\\nunlike.  You are each of you so complying, that nothing will\\r\\never be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat\\r\\nyou; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope not so.  Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\\r\\nwould be unpardonable in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceed their income!  My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife,\\r\\n\"what are you talking of?  Why, he has four or five thousand a\\r\\nyear, and very likely more.\"  Then addressing her daughter,\\r\\n\"Oh!  my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!  I am sure I shan\\'t\\r\\nget a wink of sleep all night.  I knew how it would be.  I\\r\\nalways said it must be so, at last.  I was sure you could not\\r\\nbe so beautiful for nothing!  I remember, as soon as ever I saw\\r\\nhim, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought\\r\\nhow likely it was that you should come together.  Oh!  he is\\r\\nthe handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.  Jane was beyond\\r\\ncompetition her favourite child.  At that moment, she cared\\r\\nfor no other.  Her younger sisters soon began to make interest\\r\\nwith her for objects of happiness which she might in future be\\r\\nable to dispense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and\\r\\nKitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\\r\\nLongbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\\r\\nremaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\\r\\nneighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him\\r\\nan invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to\\r\\naccept.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\\r\\nsister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to\\r\\nbestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably\\r\\nuseful to both of them in those hours of separation that must\\r\\nsometimes occur.  In the absence of Jane, he always attached\\r\\nhimself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and\\r\\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means\\r\\nof relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling\\r\\nme that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last\\r\\nspring!  I had not believed it possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But how did he\\r\\naccount for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing.  They were certainly no\\r\\nfriends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,\\r\\nsince he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many\\r\\nrespects.  But when they see, as I trust they will, that their\\r\\nbrother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and\\r\\nwe shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we\\r\\nonce were to each other.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that\\r\\nI ever heard you utter.  Good girl!  It would vex me, indeed,\\r\\nto see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last\\r\\nNovember, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of\\r\\nmy being indifferent would have prevented his coming down\\r\\nagain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit\\r\\nof his modesty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\\r\\ndiffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\\r\\nqualities.  Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not\\r\\nbetrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had\\r\\nthe most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew\\r\\nit was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\"\\r\\ncried Jane.  \"Oh!  Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family,\\r\\nand blessed above them all!  If I could but see you as happy!\\r\\nIf there were but such another man for you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so\\r\\nhappy as you.  Till I have your disposition, your goodness,\\r\\nI never can have your happiness.  No, no, let me shift for\\r\\nmyself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet\\r\\nwith another Mr. Collins in time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be\\r\\nlong a secret.  Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to\\r\\nMrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do\\r\\nthe same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family\\r\\nin the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had\\r\\nfirst run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out\\r\\nfor misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 56\\r\\n\\r\\nONE morning, about a week after Bingley\\'s engagement with\\r\\nJane had been formed, as he and the females of the family\\r\\nwere sitting together in the dining room, their attention\\r\\nwas suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage;\\r\\nand they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.\\r\\nIt was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\\r\\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\\r\\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery\\r\\nof the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.  As it\\r\\nwas certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley\\r\\ninstantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of\\r\\nsuch an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.\\r\\nThey both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\\r\\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was\\r\\nthrown open and their visitor entered.  It was Lady Catherine\\r\\nde Bourgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\r\\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\\r\\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to\\r\\nthem, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\\r\\nmade no other reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation than a slight\\r\\ninclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\r\\nElizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her\\r\\nladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of introduction had been\\r\\nmade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a\\r\\nguest of such high importance, received her with the utmost\\r\\npoliteness.  After sitting for a moment in silence, she said\\r\\nvery stiffly to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.  That lady, I suppose,\\r\\nis your mother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And that I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady\\r\\nCatherine.  \"She is my youngest girl but one.  My youngest of\\r\\nall is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the\\r\\ngrounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon\\r\\nbecome a part of the family.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine\\r\\nafter a short silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;\\r\\nbut I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\\r\\nin summer; the windows are full west.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\\r\\nand then added,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you\\r\\nleft Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for\\r\\nher from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for\\r\\nher calling.  But no letter appeared, and she was completely\\r\\npuzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\\r\\nsome refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\\r\\nvery politely, declined eating any thing; and then, rising up,\\r\\nsaid to Elizabeth,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\\r\\nwilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be glad to take\\r\\na turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about\\r\\nthe different walks.  I think she will be pleased with the\\r\\nhermitage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her\\r\\nparasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.  As they passed\\r\\nthrough the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the\\r\\ndining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a\\r\\nshort survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\r\\nwaiting-woman was in it.  They proceeded in silence along the\\r\\ngravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\\r\\nmake no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\\r\\nthan usually insolent and disagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she\\r\\nlooked in her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\\r\\nfollowing manner: --\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason\\r\\nof my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own conscience,\\r\\nmust tell you why I come.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been at all able\\r\\nto account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you\\r\\nought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.  But however\\r\\ninsincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.\\r\\nMy character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and\\r\\nfrankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not depart from it.  A report of a most alarming\\r\\nnature reached me two days ago.  I was told that not only your\\r\\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\\r\\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all\\r\\nlikelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own\\r\\nnephew, Mr. Darcy.  Though I know it must be a scandalous\\r\\nfalsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\\r\\nthe truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off\\r\\nfor this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth,\\r\\ncolouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the\\r\\ntrouble of coming so far.  What could your ladyship propose by\\r\\nit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally\\r\\ncontradicted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\\r\\nindeed, such a report is in existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If!  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has it not\\r\\nbeen industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do you not know\\r\\nthat such a report is spread abroad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation\\r\\nfor it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your\\r\\nladyship.  You may ask questions which I shall not\\r\\nchoose to answer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is not to be borne.  Miss Bennet, I insist on being\\r\\nsatisfied.  Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of\\r\\nmarriage?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\\r\\nhis reason.  But your arts and allurements may, in a moment\\r\\nof infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself\\r\\nand to all his family.  You may have drawn him in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?  I have not been accustomed\\r\\nto such language as this.  I am almost the nearest relation he\\r\\nhas in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest\\r\\nconcerns.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such\\r\\nbehaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me be rightly understood.  This match, to which you have\\r\\nthe presumption to aspire, can never take place.  No, never.\\r\\nMr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.  Now what have you to\\r\\nsay?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\\r\\nhe will make an offer to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.  From their\\r\\ninfancy, they have been intended for each other.  It was the\\r\\nfavourite wish of his mother, as well as of her\\'s.  While in\\r\\ntheir cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment\\r\\nwhen the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\\r\\nmarriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,\\r\\nof no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the\\r\\nfamily!  Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\\r\\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?  Are you lost to\\r\\nevery feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard\\r\\nme say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his\\r\\ncousin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that to me?  If\\r\\nthere is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\\r\\ncertainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and\\r\\naunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.  You both did as much\\r\\nas you could in planning the marriage.  Its completion depended\\r\\non others.  If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\\r\\nconfined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?\\r\\nAnd if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\r\\nYes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed\\r\\nby his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\\r\\ninclinations of all.  You will be censured, slighted, and\\r\\ndespised, by every one connected with him.  Your alliance will\\r\\nbe a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any\\r\\nof us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"But the\\r\\nwife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of\\r\\nhappiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she\\r\\ncould, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl!  I am ashamed of you!  Is this\\r\\nyour gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?  Is\\r\\nnothing due to me on that score?  Let us sit down.  You are to\\r\\nunderstand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined\\r\\nresolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded\\r\\nfrom it.  I have not been used to submit to any person\\'s whims.\\r\\nI have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more\\r\\npitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will not be interrupted.  Hear me in silence.  My daughter\\r\\nand my nephew are formed for each other.  They are descended,\\r\\non the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the\\r\\nfather\\'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient -- though\\r\\nuntitled -- families.  Their fortune on both sides is splendid.\\r\\nThey are destined for each other by the voice of every member\\r\\nof their respective houses; and what is to divide them?  The\\r\\nupstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\\r\\nconnections, or fortune.  Is this to be endured!  But it\\r\\nmust not, shall not be.  If you were sensible of your own\\r\\ngood, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you\\r\\nhave been brought up.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\\r\\nquitting that sphere.  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s\\r\\ndaughter; so far we are equal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True.  You are a gentleman\\'s daughter.  But who was your\\r\\nmother?  Who are your uncles and aunts?  Do not imagine me\\r\\nignorant of their condition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your\\r\\nnephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging\\r\\nLady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but\\r\\nsay, after a moment\\'s deliberation,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\\r\\nengagement?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.  I expected to find a\\r\\nmore reasonable young woman.  But do not deceive yourself into\\r\\na belief that I will ever recede.  I shall not go away till you\\r\\nhave given me the assurance I require.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And I certainly never shall give it.  I am not to be\\r\\nintimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.  Your\\r\\nladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would\\r\\nmy giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at\\r\\nall more probable?  Supposing him to be attached to me,\\r\\nwould my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow\\r\\nit on his cousin?  Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the\\r\\narguments with which you have supported this extraordinary\\r\\napplication have been as frivolous as the application was\\r\\nill-judged.  You have widely mistaken my character, if you\\r\\nthink I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\\r\\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in\\r\\nhis affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no\\r\\nright to concern yourself in mine.  I must beg, therefore,\\r\\nto be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please.  I have by no means done.\\r\\nTo all the objections I have already urged, I have still\\r\\nanother to add.  I am no stranger to the particulars of your\\r\\nyoungest sister\\'s infamous elopement.  I know it all; that\\r\\nthe young man\\'s marrying her was a patched-up business, at\\r\\nthe expence of your father and uncles.  And is such a girl\\r\\nto be my nephew\\'s sister?  Is her husband, is the son of\\r\\nhis late father\\'s steward, to be his brother?  Heaven and\\r\\nearth! -- of what are you thinking?  Are the shades of\\r\\nPemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You can now have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully\\r\\nanswered.  \"You have insulted me in every possible method.\\r\\nI must beg to return to the house.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she rose as she spoke.  Lady Catherine rose also, and they\\r\\nturned back.  Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\\r\\nnephew!  Unfeeling, selfish girl!  Do you not consider that\\r\\na connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of\\r\\neverybody?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.  You know my\\r\\nsentiments.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have said no such thing.  I am only resolved to act in that\\r\\nmanner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\\r\\nwithout reference to you, or to any person so wholly\\r\\nunconnected with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is well.  You refuse, then, to oblige me.  You refuse to\\r\\nobey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.  You are\\r\\ndetermined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and\\r\\nmake him the contempt of the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth,\\r\\n\"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.  No\\r\\nprinciple of either would be violated by my marriage with\\r\\nMr. Darcy.  And with regard to the resentment of his family, or\\r\\nthe indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his\\r\\nmarrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s concern -- and\\r\\nthe world in general would have too much sense to join in the\\r\\nscorn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this is your real opinion!  This is your final resolve!\\r\\nVery well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do not imagine, Miss\\r\\nBennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.  I came to\\r\\ntry you.  I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it,\\r\\nI will carry my point.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\\r\\ndoor of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,\\r\\n\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I send no compliments to\\r\\nyour mother.  You deserve no such attention.  I am most\\r\\nseriously displeased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade\\r\\nher ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\\r\\nherself.  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up\\r\\nstairs.  Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\\r\\ndressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in\\r\\nagain and rest herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman!  and her calling here was\\r\\nprodigiously civil!  for she only came, I suppose, to tell us\\r\\nthe Collinses were well.  She is on her road somewhere, I dare\\r\\nsay, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well\\r\\ncall on you.  I suppose she had nothing particular to say to\\r\\nyou, Lizzy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here;\\r\\nfor to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 57\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit\\r\\nthrew Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could\\r\\nshe, for many hours, learn to think of it less than\\r\\nincessantly.  Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken\\r\\nthe trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose\\r\\nof breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.  It was\\r\\na rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of\\r\\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to\\r\\nimagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate\\r\\nfriend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was\\r\\nenough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made\\r\\nevery body eager for another, to supply the idea.  She had not\\r\\nherself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must\\r\\nbring them more frequently together.  And her neighbours at\\r\\nLucas lodge, therefore (for through their communication with\\r\\nthe Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady\\r\\nCatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and\\r\\nimmediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at\\r\\nsome future time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could\\r\\nnot help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence\\r\\nof her persisting in this interference.  From what she had said\\r\\nof her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\\r\\nElizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\\r\\nand how he might take a similar representation of the evils\\r\\nattached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.\\r\\nShe knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or\\r\\nhis dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\\r\\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could\\r\\ndo; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a\\r\\nmarriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal\\r\\nto his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.\\r\\nWith his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the\\r\\narguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous,\\r\\ncontained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which\\r\\nhad often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a\\r\\nrelation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\\r\\nbe as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.  In that\\r\\ncase he would return no more.  Lady Catherine might see him in\\r\\nher way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming\\r\\nagain to Netherfield must give way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should\\r\\ncome to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall\\r\\nknow how to understand it.  I shall then give over every\\r\\nexpectation, every wish of his constancy.  If he is satisfied\\r\\nwith only regretting me, when he might have obtained my\\r\\naffections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\\r\\nvisitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\\r\\nit, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much\\r\\nteazing on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by\\r\\nher father, who came out of his library with a letter in his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my\\r\\nroom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he\\r\\nhad to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being\\r\\nin some manner connected with the letter he held.  It suddenly\\r\\nstruck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she\\r\\nanticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\\r\\ndown.  He then said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\r\\nexceedingly.  As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to\\r\\nknow its contents.  I did not know before, that I had two\\r\\ndaughters on the brink of matrimony.  Let me congratulate you\\r\\non a very important conquest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the\\r\\ninstantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\\r\\ninstead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to\\r\\nbe pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that\\r\\nhis letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\\r\\ncontinued,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You look conscious.  Young ladies have great penetration in\\r\\nsuch matters as these; but I think I may defy even your\\r\\nsagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.  This letter\\r\\nis from Mr. Collins.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From Mr. Collins!  and what can he have to say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course.  He begins\\r\\nwith congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest\\r\\ndaughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\\r\\ngood-natured, gossiping Lucases.  I shall not sport with your\\r\\nimpatience, by reading what he says on that point.  What\\r\\nrelates to yourself, is as follows.\"  \"Having thus offered\\r\\nyou the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\\r\\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject\\r\\nof another; of which we have been advertised by the same\\r\\nauthority.  Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not\\r\\nlong bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has\\r\\nresigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be\\r\\nreasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious\\r\\npersonages in this land.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\"  \"This\\r\\nyoung gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing\\r\\nthe heart of mortal can most desire, -- splendid property,\\r\\nnoble kindred, and extensive patronage.  Yet in spite of all\\r\\nthese temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and\\r\\nyourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure\\r\\nwith this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be\\r\\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?  But now it\\r\\ncomes out.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My motive for cautioning you is as follows.  We have reason to\\r\\nimagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look\\r\\non the match with a friendly eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man!  Now, Lizzy, I think I\\r\\nhave surprised you.  Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched\\r\\non any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name\\r\\nwould have given the lie more effectually to what they related?\\r\\nMr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish,\\r\\nand who probably never looked at you in his life!  It is\\r\\nadmirable!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could\\r\\nonly force one most reluctant smile.  Never had his wit been\\r\\ndirected in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  yes.  Pray read on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\\r\\nladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\\r\\ncondescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it\\r\\nbecome apparent, that on the score of some family objections on\\r\\nthe part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what\\r\\nshe termed so disgraceful a match.  I thought it my duty to\\r\\ngive the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\\r\\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and\\r\\nnot run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly\\r\\nsanctioned.\"  \"Mr. Collins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced\\r\\nthat my cousin Lydia\\'s sad business has been so well hushed up,\\r\\nand am only concerned that their living together before the\\r\\nmarriage took place should be so generally known.  I must not,\\r\\nhowever, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from\\r\\ndeclaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\\r\\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married.  It was an\\r\\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn,\\r\\nI should very strenuously have opposed it.  You ought certainly\\r\\nto forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your\\r\\nsight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\"\\r\\n\"That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!  The rest of\\r\\nhis letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s situation, and\\r\\nhis expectation of a young olive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look\\r\\nas if you did not enjoy it.  You are not going to be Missish,\\r\\nI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.  For\\r\\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and\\r\\nlaugh at them in our turn?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted.  But it is\\r\\nso strange!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes -- that is what makes it amusing.  Had they fixed on\\r\\nany other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect\\r\\nindifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so\\r\\ndelightfully absurd!  Much as I abominate writing, I would not\\r\\ngive up Mr. Collins\\'s correspondence for any consideration.\\r\\nNay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the\\r\\npreference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\\r\\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law.  And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady\\r\\nCatherine about this report?  Did she call to refuse her\\r\\nconsent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and\\r\\nas it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\\r\\ndistressed by his repeating it.  Elizabeth had never been\\r\\nmore at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\\r\\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\\r\\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder\\r\\nat such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\\r\\nhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 58\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTEAD of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,\\r\\nas Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to\\r\\nbring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed\\r\\nafter Lady Catherine\\'s visit.  The gentlemen arrived early;\\r\\nand, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having\\r\\nseen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread,\\r\\nBingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all\\r\\nwalking out.  It was agreed to.  Mrs. Bennet was not in the\\r\\nhabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the\\r\\nremaining five set off together.  Bingley and Jane, however,\\r\\nsoon allowed the others to outstrip them.  They lagged behind,\\r\\nwhile Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\\r\\nVery little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of\\r\\nhim to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate\\r\\nresolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\\r\\nupon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a\\r\\ngeneral concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with\\r\\nhim alone.  Now was the moment for her resolution to be\\r\\nexecuted, and, while her courage was high, she immediately\\r\\nsaid,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of\\r\\ngiving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be\\r\\nwounding your\\'s.  I can no longer help thanking you for your\\r\\nunexampled kindness to my poor sister.  Ever since I have known\\r\\nit, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how\\r\\ngratefully I feel it.  Were it known to the rest of my family,\\r\\nI should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of\\r\\nsurprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what\\r\\nmay, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.  I did not\\r\\nthink Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must not blame my aunt.  Lydia\\'s thoughtlessness first\\r\\nbetrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and,\\r\\nof course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.  Let\\r\\nme thank you again and again, in the name of all my family,\\r\\nfor that generous compassion which induced you to take so much\\r\\ntrouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of\\r\\ndiscovering them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you will thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself\\r\\nalone.  That the wish of giving happiness to you might add\\r\\nforce to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not\\r\\nattempt to deny.  But your family owe me nothing.  Much as\\r\\nI respect them, I believe I thought only of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.  After a\\r\\nshort pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to\\r\\ntrifle with me.  If your feelings are still what they were\\r\\nlast April, tell me so at once.  My affections and wishes\\r\\nare unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this\\r\\nsubject for ever.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and\\r\\nanxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and\\r\\nimmediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand\\r\\nthat her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since\\r\\nthe period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with\\r\\ngratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness\\r\\nwhich this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\\r\\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as\\r\\nsensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be\\r\\nsupposed to do.  Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his\\r\\neye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt\\r\\ndelight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she\\r\\ncould not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings,\\r\\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\\r\\naffection every moment more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction.  There was\\r\\ntoo much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to\\r\\nany other objects.  She soon learnt that they were indebted\\r\\nfor their present good understanding to the efforts of his\\r\\naunt, who did call on him in her return through London,\\r\\nand there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and\\r\\nthe substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling\\r\\nemphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her\\r\\nladyship\\'s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness\\r\\nand assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist\\r\\nher endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which\\r\\nshe had refused to give.  But, unluckily for her ladyship,\\r\\nits effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever\\r\\nallowed myself to hope before.  I knew enough of your\\r\\ndisposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely,\\r\\nirrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged\\r\\nit to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know\\r\\nenough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.\\r\\nAfter abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no\\r\\nscruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?  For, though\\r\\nyour accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises,\\r\\nmy behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest\\r\\nreproof.  It was unpardonable.  I cannot think of it without\\r\\nabhorrence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to\\r\\nthat evening,\" said Elizabeth.  \"The conduct of neither, if\\r\\nstrictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we\\r\\nhave both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.  The recollection\\r\\nof what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions\\r\\nduring the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,\\r\\ninexpressibly painful to me.  Your reproof, so well applied, I\\r\\nshall never forget: ``had you behaved in a more gentleman-like\\r\\nmanner.\\'\\' Those were your words.  You know not, you can\\r\\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; -- though it was\\r\\nsome time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow\\r\\ntheir justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong\\r\\nan impression.  I had not the smallest idea of their being ever\\r\\nfelt in such a way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can easily believe it.  You thought me then devoid of\\r\\nevery proper feeling, I am sure you did.  The turn of your\\r\\ncountenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could\\r\\nnot have addressed you in any possible way that would induce\\r\\nyou to accept me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh!  do not repeat what I then said.  These recollections\\r\\nwill not do at all.  I assure you that I have long been most\\r\\nheartily ashamed of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDarcy mentioned his letter.  \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon\\r\\nmake you think better of me?  Did you, on reading it, give any\\r\\ncredit to its contents?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how\\r\\ngradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain,\\r\\nbut it was necessary.  I hope you have destroyed the letter.\\r\\nThere was one part especially, the opening of it, which I\\r\\nshould dread your having the power of reading again.  I can\\r\\nremember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it\\r\\nessential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have\\r\\nboth reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they\\r\\nare not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself\\r\\nperfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was\\r\\nwritten in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end\\r\\nso.  The adieu is charity itself.  But think no more of the\\r\\nletter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person\\r\\nwho received it, are now so widely different from what they\\r\\nwere then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it\\r\\nought to be forgotten.  You must learn some of my philosophy.\\r\\nThink only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\\r\\nYour retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that\\r\\nthe contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,\\r\\nwhat is much better, of innocence.  But with me, it is not\\r\\nso.  Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which\\r\\nought not, to be repelled.  I have been a selfish being all my\\r\\nlife, in practice, though not in principle.  As a child I was\\r\\ntaught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my\\r\\ntemper.  I was given good principles, but left to follow them\\r\\nin pride and conceit.  Unfortunately an only son (for many\\r\\nyears an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though\\r\\ngood themselves (my father, particularly, all that was\\r\\nbenevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me\\r\\nto be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own\\r\\nfamily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to\\r\\nwish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth\\r\\ncompared with my own.  Such I was, from eight to eight and\\r\\ntwenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,\\r\\nloveliest Elizabeth!  What do I not owe you!  You taught me a\\r\\nlesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.  By you,\\r\\nI was properly humbled.  I came to you without a doubt of my\\r\\nreception.  You shewed me how insufficient were all my\\r\\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed I had.  What will you think of my vanity?  I believed\\r\\nyou to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally,\\r\\nI assure you.  I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits\\r\\nmight often lead me wrong.  How you must have hated me after\\r\\nthat evening?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hate you!  I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon\\r\\nbegan to take a proper direction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we\\r\\nmet at Pemberley.  You blamed me for coming?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being\\r\\nnoticed by you.  My conscience told me that I deserved no\\r\\nextraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect\\r\\nto receive more than my due.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every\\r\\ncivility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the\\r\\npast; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your\\r\\nill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been\\r\\nattended to.  How soon any other wishes introduced themselves\\r\\nI can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after\\r\\nI had seen you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance,\\r\\nand of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which\\r\\nnaturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon\\r\\nlearnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in\\r\\nquest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn,\\r\\nand that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from\\r\\nno other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\\r\\nsubject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy\\r\\nto know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining\\r\\ntheir watches, that it was time to be at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a wonder\\r\\nwhich introduced the discussion of their affairs.  Darcy\\r\\nwas delighted with their engagement; his friend had given\\r\\nhim the earliest information of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all.  When I went away, I felt that it would soon\\r\\nhappen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission.  I guessed as\\r\\nmuch.\"  And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it\\r\\nhad been pretty much the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I made a\\r\\nconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long\\r\\nago.  I told him of all that had occurred to make my former\\r\\ninterference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.  His\\r\\nsurprise was great.  He had never had the slightest suspicion.\\r\\nI told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in\\r\\nsupposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to\\r\\nhim; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her\\r\\nwas unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of\\r\\ndirecting his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she, \"when\\r\\nyou told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my\\r\\ninformation last spring?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From the former.  I had narrowly observed her during the two\\r\\nvisits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her\\r\\naffection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\\r\\nconviction to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It did.  Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.  His diffidence\\r\\nhad prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a\\r\\ncase, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.  I was\\r\\nobliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not\\r\\nunjustly, offended him.  I could not allow myself to conceal\\r\\nthat your sister had been in town three months last winter,\\r\\nthat I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.  He was\\r\\nangry.  But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than\\r\\nhe remained in any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments.  He has\\r\\nheartily forgiven me now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most\\r\\ndelightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\\r\\ninvaluable; but she checked herself.  She remembered that he\\r\\nhad yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early\\r\\nto begin.  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of\\r\\ncourse was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\\r\\nconversation till they reached the house.  In the hall they\\r\\nparted.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 59\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a\\r\\nquestion which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she\\r\\nentered their room, and from all the others when they sat down\\r\\nto table.  She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered\\r\\nabout, till she was beyond her own knowledge.  She coloured as\\r\\nshe spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a\\r\\nsuspicion of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing\\r\\nextraordinary.  The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the\\r\\nunacknowledged were silent.  Darcy was not of a disposition in\\r\\nwhich happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and\\r\\nconfused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself\\r\\nto be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were\\r\\nother evils before her.  She anticipated what would be felt in\\r\\nthe family when her situation became known; she was aware that\\r\\nno one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others\\r\\nit was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence\\r\\nmight do away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane.  Though suspicion was\\r\\nvery far from Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely\\r\\nincredulous here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy.  This cannot be! -- engaged to\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  No, no, you shall not deceive me.  I know it\\r\\nto be impossible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed!  My sole dependence was\\r\\non you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do\\r\\nnot.  Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.  I speak nothing but the\\r\\ntruth.  He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJane looked at her doubtingly.  \"Oh, Lizzy!  it cannot be.\\r\\nI know how much you dislike him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know nothing of the matter.  That is all to be forgot.\\r\\nPerhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in\\r\\nsuch cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is\\r\\nthe last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement.  Elizabeth again, and\\r\\nmore seriously assured her of its truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven!  can it be really so!  Yet now I must believe\\r\\nyou,\" cried Jane.  \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would -- I do\\r\\ncongratulate you -- but are you certain?  forgive the question\\r\\n-- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There can be no doubt of that.  It is settled between us\\r\\nalready, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.\\r\\nBut are you pleased, Jane?  Shall you like to have such a\\r\\nbrother?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very, very much.  Nothing could give either Bingley or\\r\\nmyself more delight.  But we considered it, we talked of it as\\r\\nimpossible.  And do you really love him quite well enough?\\r\\nOh, Lizzy!  do any thing rather than marry without affection.\\r\\nAre you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes!  You will only think I feel more than I ought to\\r\\ndo, when I tell you all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.\\r\\nI am afraid you will be angry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest sister, now be serious.  I want to talk very\\r\\nseriously.  Let me know every thing that I am to know, without\\r\\ndelay.  Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\\r\\nbegan.  But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his\\r\\nbeautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced\\r\\nthe desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn\\r\\nassurances of attachment.  When convinced on that article, Miss\\r\\nBennet had nothing farther to wish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as\\r\\nmyself.  I always had a value for him.  Were it for nothing but\\r\\nhis love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as\\r\\nBingley\\'s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley\\r\\nand yourself more dear to me.  But Lizzy, you have been very\\r\\nsly, very reserved with me.  How little did you tell me of what\\r\\npassed at Pemberley and Lambton!  I owe all that I know of it\\r\\nto another, not to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.  She had been\\r\\nunwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her\\r\\nown feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.\\r\\nBut now she would no longer conceal from her his share in\\r\\nLydia\\'s marriage.  All was acknowledged, and half the night\\r\\nspent in conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window\\r\\nthe next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming\\r\\nhere again with our dear Bingley!  What can he mean by being so\\r\\ntiresome as to be always coming here?  I had no notion but he\\r\\nwould go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us\\r\\nwith his company.  What shall we do with him?  Lizzy, you must\\r\\nwalk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a\\r\\nproposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be\\r\\nalways giving him such an epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,\\r\\nand shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good\\r\\ninformation; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\nhave you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her\\r\\nway again to-day?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\\r\\n\"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.  It is a nice long walk,\\r\\nand Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but\\r\\nI am sure it will be too much for Kitty.  Won\\'t it, Kitty?\"\\r\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home.  Darcy professed\\r\\na great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth\\r\\nsilently consented.  As she went up stairs to get ready,\\r\\nMrs. Bennet followed her, saying,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have\\r\\nthat disagreeable man all to yourself.  But I hope you will not\\r\\nmind it: it is all for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no\\r\\noccasion for talking to him, except just now and then.  So, do\\r\\nnot put yourself to inconvenience.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\\'s consent\\r\\nshould be asked in the course of the evening.  Elizabeth\\r\\nreserved to herself the application for her mother\\'s.  She\\r\\ncould not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes\\r\\ndoubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough\\r\\nto overcome her abhorrence of the man.  But whether she were\\r\\nviolently set against the match, or violently delighted with\\r\\nit, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted\\r\\nto do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that\\r\\nMr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the\\r\\nfirst vehemence of her disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,\\r\\nshe saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation\\r\\non seeing it was extreme.  She did not fear her father\\'s\\r\\nopposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it\\r\\nshould be through her means -- that she, his favourite child,\\r\\nshould be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him\\r\\nwith fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched\\r\\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared\\r\\nagain, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his\\r\\nsmile.  In a few minutes he approached the table where she was\\r\\nsitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work\\r\\nsaid in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in the\\r\\nlibrary.\"  She was gone directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and\\r\\nanxious.  \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing?  Are you out\\r\\nof your senses, to be accepting this man?  Have not you always\\r\\nhated him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had\\r\\nbeen more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!  It would\\r\\nhave spared her from explanations and professions which it was\\r\\nexceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and\\r\\nshe assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to\\r\\nMr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.  He is\\r\\nrich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine\\r\\ncarriages than Jane.  But will they make you happy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your\\r\\nbelief of my indifference?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"None at all.  We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort\\r\\nof man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes,\\r\\n\"I love him.  Indeed he has no improper pride.  He is perfectly\\r\\namiable.  You do not know what he really is; then pray do not\\r\\npain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent.\\r\\nHe is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare\\r\\nrefuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.  I now give it\\r\\nto you, if you are resolved on having him.  But let me advise\\r\\nyou to think better of it.  I know your disposition, Lizzy.\\r\\nI know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless\\r\\nyou truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him\\r\\nas a superior.  Your lively talents would place you in the\\r\\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage.  You could scarcely\\r\\nescape discredit and misery.  My child, let me not have the\\r\\ngrief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.\\r\\nYou know not what you are about.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her\\r\\nreply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was\\r\\nreally the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual\\r\\nchange which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her\\r\\nabsolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a\\r\\nday, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and\\r\\nenumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer\\r\\nher father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no\\r\\nmore to say.  If this be the case, he deserves you.  I could\\r\\nnot have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what\\r\\nMr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.  He heard her with\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!  And so, Darcy did\\r\\nevery thing: made up the match, gave the money, paid the\\r\\nfellow\\'s debts, and got him his commission!  So much the\\r\\nbetter.  It will save me a world of trouble and economy.\\r\\nHad it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and would have paid\\r\\nhim; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their\\r\\nown way.  I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant\\r\\nand storm about his love for you, and there will be an end\\r\\nof the matter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\\r\\nreading Mr. Collins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some\\r\\ntime, allowed her at last to go -- saying, as she quitted the\\r\\nroom, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in,\\r\\nfor I am quite at leisure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight;\\r\\nand, after half an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room,\\r\\nshe was able to join the others with tolerable composure.\\r\\nEvery thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed\\r\\ntranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to\\r\\nbe dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would\\r\\ncome in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she\\r\\nfollowed her, and made the important communication.  Its effect\\r\\nwas most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nsat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.  Nor was it\\r\\nunder many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she\\r\\nheard; though not in general backward to credit what was for\\r\\nthe advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\\r\\nlover to any of them.  She began at length to recover, to\\r\\nfidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder,\\r\\nand bless herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good gracious!  Lord bless me!  only think!  dear me!\\r\\nMr. Darcy!  Who would have thought it!  And is it really true?\\r\\nOh!  my sweetest Lizzy!  how rich and how great you will be!\\r\\nWhat pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!\\r\\nJane\\'s is nothing to it -- nothing at all.  I am so pleased --\\r\\nso happy.  Such a charming man! -- so handsome!  so tall! --\\r\\nOh, my dear Lizzy!  pray apologise for my having disliked him\\r\\nso much before.  I hope he will overlook it.  Dear, dear Lizzy.\\r\\nA house in town!  Every thing that is charming!  Three\\r\\ndaughters married!  Ten thousand a year!  Oh, Lord!  What will\\r\\nbecome of me.  I shall go distracted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\\r\\ndoubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was\\r\\nheard only by herself, soon went away.  But before she had\\r\\nbeen three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else!\\r\\nTen thousand a year, and very likely more!  \\'Tis as good as a\\r\\nLord!  And a special licence.  You must and shall be married\\r\\nby a special licence.  But my dearest love, tell me what dish\\r\\nMr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it\\r\\ntomorrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the\\r\\ngentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in\\r\\nthe certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of\\r\\nher relations\\' consent, there was still something to be wished\\r\\nfor.  But the morrow passed off much better than she expected;\\r\\nfor Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended\\r\\nson-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was\\r\\nin her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference\\r\\nfor his opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking\\r\\npains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured\\r\\nher that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he.\\r\\n\"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall\\r\\nlike your husband quite as well as Jane\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 60\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH\\'S spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she\\r\\nwanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love\\r\\nwith her.  \"How could you begin?\" said she.  \"I can comprehend\\r\\nyour going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning;\\r\\nbut what could set you off in the first place?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\\r\\nwords, which laid the foundation.  It is too long ago.  I was\\r\\nin the middle before I knew that I had begun.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners --\\r\\nmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the\\r\\nuncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to\\r\\ngive you pain than not.  Now be sincere; did you admire me for\\r\\nmy impertinence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once.  It was very\\r\\nlittle less.  The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of\\r\\ndeference, of officious attention.  You were disgusted with the\\r\\nwomen who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for\\r\\nyour approbation alone.  I roused, and interested you,\\r\\nbecause I was so unlike them.  Had you not been really\\r\\namiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the\\r\\npains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always\\r\\nnoble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the\\r\\npersons who so assiduously courted you.  There -- I have saved\\r\\nyou the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things\\r\\nconsidered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.  To be\\r\\nsure, you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of\\r\\nthat when they fall in love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\\r\\nshe was ill at Netherfield?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dearest Jane!  who could have done less for her?  But make a\\r\\nvirtue of it by all means.  My good qualities are under your\\r\\nprotection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;\\r\\nand, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing\\r\\nand quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin\\r\\ndirectly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to\\r\\nthe point at last.  What made you so shy of me, when you first\\r\\ncalled, and afterwards dined here?  Why, especially, when you\\r\\ncalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\\r\\nencouragement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And so was I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\\r\\nand that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!  But I\\r\\nwonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left\\r\\nto yourself.  I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had\\r\\nnot asked you!  My resolution of thanking you for your kindness\\r\\nto Lydia had certainly great effect.  Too much, I am\\r\\nafraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs\\r\\nfrom a breach of promise?  for I ought not to have mentioned\\r\\nthe subject.  This will never do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You need not distress yourself.  The moral will be perfectly\\r\\nfair.  Lady Catherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us\\r\\nwere the means of removing all my doubts.  I am not indebted\\r\\nfor my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing\\r\\nyour gratitude.  I was not in a humour to wait for any opening\\r\\nof your\\'s.  My aunt\\'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was\\r\\ndetermined at once to know every thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make\\r\\nher happy, for she loves to be of use.  But tell me, what did\\r\\nyou come down to Netherfield for?  Was it merely to ride to\\r\\nLongbourn and be embarrassed?  or had you intended any more\\r\\nserious consequence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could,\\r\\nwhether I might ever hope to make you love me.  My avowed one,\\r\\nor what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were\\r\\nstill partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the\\r\\nconfession to him which I have since made.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine\\r\\nwhat is to befall her?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.\\r\\nBut it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper,\\r\\nit shall be done directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\\r\\nand admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady\\r\\nonce did.  But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer\\r\\nneglected.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with\\r\\nMr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet\\r\\nanswered Mrs. Gardiner\\'s long letter; but now, having that\\r\\nto communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was\\r\\nalmost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost\\r\\nthree days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought\\r\\nto have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\\r\\nparticulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.\\r\\nYou supposed more than really existed.  But now suppose as\\r\\nmuch as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your\\r\\nimagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\r\\nafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot\\r\\ngreatly err.  You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\r\\ngreat deal more than you did in your last.  I thank you, again\\r\\nand again, for not going to the Lakes.  How could I be so silly\\r\\nas to wish it!  Your idea of the ponies is delightful.  We will\\r\\ngo round the Park every day.  I am the happiest creature in the\\r\\nworld.  Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one\\r\\nwith such justice.  I am happier even than Jane; she only\\r\\nsmiles, I laugh.  Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world\\r\\nthat he can spare from me.  You are all to come to Pemberley at\\r\\nChristmas.  Your\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Darcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;\\r\\nand still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to\\r\\nMr. Collins, in reply to his last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR,\\r\\n\\r\\nI must trouble you once more for congratulations.  Elizabeth\\r\\nwill soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.  Console Lady Catherine\\r\\nas well as you can.  But, if I were you, I would stand by the\\r\\nnephew.  He has more to give.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s sincerely, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his\\r\\napproaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and\\r\\ninsincere.  She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express\\r\\nher delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.\\r\\nJane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling\\r\\nno reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder\\r\\nanswer than she knew was deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar\\r\\ninformation, was as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it.\\r\\nFour sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her\\r\\ndelight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her\\r\\nsister.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any\\r\\ncongratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn\\r\\nfamily heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas\\r\\nlodge.  The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.\\r\\nLady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by\\r\\nthe contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that Charlotte, really\\r\\nrejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the\\r\\nstorm was blown over.  At such a moment, the arrival of\\r\\nher friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in\\r\\nthe course of their meetings she must sometimes think the\\r\\npleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all\\r\\nthe parading and obsequious civility of her husband.  He bore\\r\\nit, however, with admirable calmness.  He could even listen to\\r\\nSir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\\r\\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of\\r\\ntheir all meeting frequently at St. James\\'s, with very decent\\r\\ncomposure.  If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir\\r\\nWilliam was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Phillips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater,\\r\\ntax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as\\r\\nher sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the\\r\\nfamiliarity which Bingley\\'s good humour encouraged, yet,\\r\\nwhenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.  Nor was her\\r\\nrespect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely\\r\\nto make her more elegant.  Elizabeth did all she could to\\r\\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever\\r\\nanxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with\\r\\nwhom he might converse without mortification; and though the\\r\\nuncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the\\r\\nseason of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope\\r\\nof the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time\\r\\nwhen they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\\r\\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party\\r\\nat Pemberley.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 61\\r\\n\\r\\nHAPPY for all her maternal feelings was the day on which\\r\\nMrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\r\\nWith what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,\\r\\nand talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.  I wish I could say,\\r\\nfor the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her\\r\\nearnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children\\r\\nproduced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,\\r\\nwell-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it\\r\\nwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic\\r\\nfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally\\r\\nnervous and invariably silly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his\\r\\naffection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing\\r\\nelse could do.  He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially\\r\\nwhen he was least expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a\\r\\ntwelvemonth.  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton\\r\\nrelations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her\\r\\naffectionate heart.  The darling wish of his sisters was then\\r\\ngratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to\\r\\nDerbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other\\r\\nsource of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\\r\\ntime with her two elder sisters.  In society so superior to\\r\\nwhat she had generally known, her improvement was great.  She\\r\\nwas not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from\\r\\nthe influence of Lydia\\'s example, she became, by proper\\r\\nattention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and\\r\\nless insipid.  From the farther disadvantage of Lydia\\'s society\\r\\nshe was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\\r\\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the\\r\\npromise of balls and young men, her father would never consent\\r\\nto her going.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\\r\\nnecessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by\\r\\nMrs. Bennet\\'s being quite unable to sit alone.  Mary was\\r\\nobliged to mix more with the world, but she could still\\r\\nmoralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer\\r\\nmortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her\\r\\nown, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to\\r\\nthe change without much reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no\\r\\nrevolution from the marriage of her sisters.  He bore with\\r\\nphilosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become\\r\\nacquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood\\r\\nhad before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing,\\r\\nwas not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed\\r\\non to make his fortune.  The congratulatory letter which\\r\\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to\\r\\nher that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a\\r\\nhope was cherished.  The letter was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish you joy.  If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my\\r\\ndear Wickham, you must be very happy.  It is a great comfort to\\r\\nhave you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope\\r\\nyou will think of us.  I am sure Wickham would like a place at\\r\\ncourt very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money\\r\\nenough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of\\r\\nabout three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak\\r\\nto Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour\\'s, &c.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she\\r\\nendeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty\\r\\nand expectation of the kind.  Such relief, however, as it\\r\\nwas in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be\\r\\ncalled economy in her own private expences, she frequently\\r\\nsent them.  It had always been evident to her that such an\\r\\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so\\r\\nextravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must\\r\\nbe very insufficient to their support; and whenever they\\r\\nchanged their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of\\r\\nbeing applied to for some little assistance towards discharging\\r\\ntheir bills.  Their manner of living, even when the restoration\\r\\nof peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\\r\\nextreme.  They were always moving from place to place in quest\\r\\nof a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.\\r\\nHis affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her\\'s lasted\\r\\na little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she\\r\\nretained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had\\r\\ngiven her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.\\r\\nLydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was\\r\\ngone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys\\r\\nthey both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\'s\\r\\ngood humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk\\r\\nof giving them a hint to be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but\\r\\nas she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at\\r\\nPemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever\\r\\nof Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and\\r\\npaid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the\\r\\nsisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.  They were\\r\\nable to love each other even as well as they intended.\\r\\nGeorgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;\\r\\nthough at first she often listened with an astonishment\\r\\nbordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking\\r\\nto her brother.  He, who had always inspired in herself a\\r\\nrespect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the\\r\\nobject of open pleasantry.  Her mind received knowledge which\\r\\nhad never before fallen in her way.  By Elizabeth\\'s\\r\\ninstructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take\\r\\nliberties with her husband which a brother will not always\\r\\nallow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\\r\\nnephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her\\r\\ncharacter in her reply to the letter which announced its\\r\\narrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially\\r\\nof Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.\\r\\nBut at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion, he was prevailed on\\r\\nto overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after\\r\\na little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\\r\\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her\\r\\ncuriosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she\\r\\ncondescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that\\r\\npollution which its woods had received, not merely from the\\r\\npresence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and\\r\\naunt from the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate\\r\\nterms.  Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and\\r\\nthey were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards\\r\\nthe persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the\\r\\nmeans of uniting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

All Huntingdon exclaimed on the\\r\\ngreatness of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her\\r\\nto be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it.\\r\\nShe had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of their\\r\\nacquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome as\\r\\nMiss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal\\r\\nadvantage. But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in\\r\\nthe world as there are pretty women to deserve them. Miss Ward, at the\\r\\nend of half a dozen years, found herself obliged to be attached to\\r\\nthe Rev. Mr. Norris, a friend of her brother-in-law, with scarcely any\\r\\nprivate fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse. Miss Ward's match,\\r\\nindeed, when it came to the point, was not contemptible: Sir Thomas\\r\\nbeing happily able to give his friend an income in the living of\\r\\nMansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal\\r\\nfelicity with very little less than a thousand a year. But Miss Frances\\r\\nmarried, in the common phrase, to disoblige her family, and by fixing on\\r\\na lieutenant of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions, did\\r\\nit very thoroughly. She could hardly have made a more untoward choice.\\r\\nSir Thomas Bertram had interest, which, from principle as well as\\r\\npride--from a general wish of doing right, and a desire of seeing all\\r\\nthat were connected with him in situations of respectability, he would\\r\\nhave been glad to exert for the advantage of Lady Bertram's sister; but\\r\\nher husband's profession was such as no interest could reach; and before\\r\\nhe had time to devise any other method of assisting them, an absolute\\r\\nbreach between the sisters had taken place. It was the natural result of\\r\\nthe conduct of each party, and such as a very imprudent marriage almost\\r\\nalways produces. To save herself from useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price\\r\\nnever wrote to her family on the subject till actually married. Lady\\r\\nBertram, who was a woman of very tranquil feelings, and a temper\\r\\nremarkably easy and indolent, would have contented herself with merely\\r\\ngiving up her sister, and thinking no more of the matter; but Mrs.\\r\\nNorris had a spirit of activity, which could not be satisfied till she\\r\\nhad written a long and angry letter to Fanny, to point out the folly of\\r\\nher conduct, and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences.\\r\\nMrs. Price, in her turn, was injured and angry; and an answer, which\\r\\ncomprehended each sister in its bitterness, and bestowed such very\\r\\ndisrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norris\\r\\ncould not possibly keep to herself, put an end to all intercourse\\r\\nbetween them for a considerable period.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so\\r\\ndistinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each\\r\\nother's existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to\\r\\nmake it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have\\r\\nit in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry\\r\\nvoice, that Fanny had got another child. By the end of eleven years,\\r\\nhowever, Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or\\r\\nresentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her.\\r\\nA large and still increasing family, an husband disabled for active\\r\\nservice, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a very\\r\\nsmall income to supply their wants, made her eager to regain the friends\\r\\nshe had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed Lady Bertram in\\r\\na letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence, such a\\r\\nsuperfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything else, as\\r\\ncould not but dispose them all to a reconciliation. She was preparing\\r\\nfor her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance, and\\r\\nimploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, she\\r\\ncould not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future\\r\\nmaintenance of the eight already in being. Her eldest was a boy of ten\\r\\nyears old, a fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world;\\r\\nbut what could she do? Was there any chance of his being hereafter\\r\\nuseful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property?\\r\\nNo situation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas think of\\r\\nWoolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to the East?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter was not unproductive. It re-established peace and kindness.\\r\\nSir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram dispatched\\r\\nmoney and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a more\\r\\nimportant advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it. Mrs. Norris was\\r\\noften observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister and\\r\\nher family out of her head, and that, much as they had all done for her,\\r\\nshe seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she could not but\\r\\nown it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from the\\r\\ncharge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\nif they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter,\\r\\na girl now nine years old, of an age to require more attention than her\\r\\npoor mother could possibly give? The trouble and expense of it to them\\r\\nwould be nothing, compared with the benevolence of the action.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lady\\r\\nBertram agreed with her instantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we cannot do better,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nshe; \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet us send for the child.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent. He\\r\\ndebated and hesitated;--it was a serious charge;--a girl so brought up\\r\\nmust be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty instead\\r\\nof kindness in taking her from her family. He thought of his own four\\r\\nchildren, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;--but no sooner\\r\\nhad he deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs. Norris\\r\\ninterrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the\\r\\ngenerosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a\\r\\npiece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in\\r\\nthe main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of\\r\\nproviding for a child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands;\\r\\nand I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my\\r\\nmite upon such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I\\r\\nlook to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the children\\r\\nof my sisters?--and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just--but you know I am\\r\\na woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be frightened from\\r\\na good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and introduce\\r\\nher properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means of\\r\\nsettling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of ours, Sir\\r\\nThomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up in this\\r\\nneighbourhood without many advantages. I don't say she would be so\\r\\nhandsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would be\\r\\nintroduced into the society of this country under such very favourable\\r\\ncircumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable\\r\\nestablishment. You are thinking of your sons--but do not you know that,\\r\\nof all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, brought\\r\\nup as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It is\\r\\nmorally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, the\\r\\nonly sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her a pretty\\r\\ngirl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence,\\r\\nand I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her having been\\r\\nsuffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect,\\r\\nwould be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered boys in love\\r\\nwith her. But breed her up with them from this time, and suppose her\\r\\neven to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be more to\\r\\neither than a sister.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a great deal of truth in what you say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Sir Thomas,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a\\r\\nplan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each.\\r\\nI only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in,\\r\\nand that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable to\\r\\nourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged to\\r\\nsecure to her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision of\\r\\na gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are so\\r\\nsanguine in expecting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thoroughly understand you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are everything\\r\\nthat is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagree\\r\\non this point. Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready\\r\\nenough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I could never\\r\\nfeel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your\\r\\nown dear children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own,\\r\\nI should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her. Is not she a\\r\\nsister's child? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of\\r\\nbread to give her? My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm\\r\\nheart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of\\r\\nlife than do an ungenerous thing. So, if you are not against it, I will\\r\\nwrite to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon\\r\\nas matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield;\\r\\n_you_ shall have no trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never\\r\\nregard. I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bed\\r\\nat her cousin the saddler's, and the child be appointed to meet her\\r\\nthere. They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach,\\r\\nunder the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going. I\\r\\ndare say there is always some reputable tradesman's wife or other going\\r\\nup.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept to the attack on Nanny's cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any\\r\\nobjection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous\\r\\nbeing accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled,\\r\\nand the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed. The\\r\\ndivision of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to\\r\\nhave been equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and\\r\\nconsistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the\\r\\nleast intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance.\\r\\nAs far as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughly\\r\\nbenevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others;\\r\\nbut her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knew\\r\\nquite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.\\r\\nHaving married on a narrower income than she had been used to look\\r\\nforward to, she had, from the first, fancied a very strict line of\\r\\neconomy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon grew\\r\\ninto a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitude which\\r\\nthere were no children to supply. Had there been a family to provide\\r\\nfor, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money; but having no care\\r\\nof that kind, there was nothing to impede her frugality, or lessen the\\r\\ncomfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never\\r\\nlived up to. Under this infatuating principle, counteracted by no real\\r\\naffection for her sister, it was impossible for her to aim at more than\\r\\nthe credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity; though\\r\\nperhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the\\r\\nParsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief of being the\\r\\nmost liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully\\r\\nexplained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram's calm inquiry of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere shall\\r\\nthe child come to first, sister, to you or to us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sir Thomas heard with\\r\\nsome surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris's power to\\r\\ntake any share in the personal charge of her. He had been considering\\r\\nher as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as a desirable\\r\\ncompanion to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he found\\r\\nhimself wholly mistaken. Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the little\\r\\ngirl's staying with them, at least as things then were, was quite out of\\r\\nthe question. Poor Mr. Norris's indifferent state of health made it an\\r\\nimpossibility: he could no more bear the noise of a child than he could\\r\\nfly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of his gouty complaints, it\\r\\nwould be a different matter: she should then be glad to take her turn,\\r\\nand think nothing of the inconvenience; but just now, poor Mr. Norris\\r\\ntook up every moment of her time, and the very mention of such a thing\\r\\nshe was sure would distract him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen she had better come to us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram, with the utmost\\r\\ncomposure. After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, let\\r\\nher home be in this house. We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and\\r\\nshe will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age, and\\r\\nof a regular instructress.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich are both very important\\r\\nconsiderations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has\\r\\nthree girls to teach, or only two--there can be no difference. I only\\r\\nwish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I am not\\r\\none of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetch her,\\r\\nhowever it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away\\r\\nfor three days. I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the little\\r\\nwhite attic, near the old nurseries. It will be much the best place\\r\\nfor her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and close by the\\r\\nhousemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, you know, and\\r\\ntake care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not think it fair to\\r\\nexpect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others. Indeed, I do not see\\r\\nthat you could possibly place her anywhere else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram made no opposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mrs. Norris,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShould her disposition be really bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe must not,\\r\\nfor our own children's sake, continue her in the family; but there is\\r\\nno reason to expect so great an evil. We shall probably see much to wish\\r\\naltered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, some\\r\\nmeanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner; but\\r\\nthese are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous for\\r\\nher associates. Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, I should\\r\\nhave considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very\\r\\nserious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to fear for\\r\\n_them_, and everything to hope for _her_, from the association.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly what I think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand what I was\\r\\nsaying to my husband this morning. It will be an education for the\\r\\nchild, said I, only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her\\r\\nnothing, she would learn to be good and clever from _them_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope she will not tease my poor pug,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have but\\r\\njust got Julia to leave it alone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Sir\\r\\nThomas, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas to the distinction proper to be made between the girls\\r\\nas they grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ the\\r\\nconsciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of\\r\\ntheir cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make\\r\\nher remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_. I should wish to see them\\r\\nvery good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girls the\\r\\nsmallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still they\\r\\ncannot be equals. Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations will\\r\\nalways be different. It is a point of great delicacy, and you must\\r\\nassist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of\\r\\nconduct.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreed\\r\\nwith him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hope\\r\\nthat between them it would be easily managed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her sister\\r\\nin vain. Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be\\r\\nfixed on, when she had so many fine boys, but accepted the offer most\\r\\nthankfully, assuring them of her daughter's being a very well-disposed,\\r\\ngood-humoured girl, and trusting they would never have cause to throw\\r\\nher off. She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny, but was\\r\\nsanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air.\\r\\nPoor woman! she probably thought change of air might agree with many of\\r\\nher children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl performed her long journey in safety; and at Northampton\\r\\nwas met by Mrs. Norris, who thus regaled in the credit of being foremost\\r\\nto welcome her, and in the importance of leading her in to the others,\\r\\nand recommending her to their kindness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might\\r\\nnot be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,\\r\\nnothing to disgust her relations. She was small of her age, with no glow\\r\\nof complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid and shy,\\r\\nand shrinking from notice; but her air, though awkward, was not vulgar,\\r\\nher voice was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was pretty. Sir\\r\\nThomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly; and Sir Thomas,\\r\\nseeing how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all that was\\r\\nconciliating: but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of\\r\\ndeportment; and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or\\r\\nspeaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid of a good-humoured\\r\\nsmile, became immediately the less awful character of the two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young people were all at home, and sustained their share in the\\r\\nintroduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, at\\r\\nleast on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tall\\r\\nof their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little\\r\\ncousin. The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in\\r\\ngreater awe of their father, who addressed them on the occasion with\\r\\nrather an injudicious particularity. But they were too much used to\\r\\ncompany and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their\\r\\nconfidence increasing from their cousin's total want of it, they were\\r\\nsoon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy\\r\\nindifference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, the\\r\\ndaughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward of\\r\\ntheir age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousins\\r\\nin person, as education had given to their address; and no one would\\r\\nhave supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were. There\\r\\nwere in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny. Julia\\r\\nBertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older. The little visitor\\r\\nmeanwhile was as unhappy as possible. Afraid of everybody, ashamed of\\r\\nherself, and longing for the home she had left, she knew not how to look\\r\\nup, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying. Mrs. Norris\\r\\nhad been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her wonderful\\r\\ngood fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and good\\r\\nbehaviour which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of misery was\\r\\ntherefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her\\r\\nnot to be happy. The fatigue, too, of so long a journey, became soon no\\r\\ntrifling evil. In vain were the well-meant condescensions of Sir Thomas,\\r\\nand all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be\\r\\na good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa\\r\\nwith herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart\\r\\ntowards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls\\r\\nbefore tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her likeliest\\r\\nfriend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not a very promising beginning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Norris, when Fanny\\r\\nhad left the room. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter all that I said to her as we came along, I\\r\\nthought she would have behaved better; I told her how much might depend\\r\\nupon her acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not be a\\r\\nlittle sulkiness of temper--her poor mother had a good deal; but we must\\r\\nmake allowances for such a child--and I do not know that her being sorry\\r\\nto leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults,\\r\\nit _was_ her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has\\r\\nchanged for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris was inclined to\\r\\nallow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and the\\r\\nseparation from everybody she had been used to. Her feelings were very\\r\\nacute, and too little understood to be properly attended to. Nobody\\r\\nmeant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure\\r\\nher comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day, on purpose to\\r\\nafford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining their young\\r\\ncousin, produced little union. They could not but hold her cheap on\\r\\nfinding that she had but two sashes, and had never learned French; and\\r\\nwhen they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were so\\r\\ngood as to play, they could do no more than make her a generous present\\r\\nof some of their least valued toys, and leave her to herself, while\\r\\nthey adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport of the\\r\\nmoment, making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in the schoolroom, the\\r\\ndrawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding something\\r\\nto fear in every person and place. She was disheartened by Lady\\r\\nBertram's silence, awed by Sir Thomas's grave looks, and quite overcome\\r\\nby Mrs. Norris's admonitions. Her elder cousins mortified her by\\r\\nreflections on her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: Miss\\r\\nLee wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her\\r\\nclothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers\\r\\nand sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow,\\r\\ninstructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her little heart was\\r\\nsevere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her. The\\r\\nrooms were too large for her to move in with ease: whatever she touched\\r\\nshe expected to injure, and she crept about in constant terror of\\r\\nsomething or other; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry; and\\r\\nthe little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left it\\r\\nat night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune,\\r\\nended every day's sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep. A week had\\r\\npassed in this way, and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet\\r\\npassive manner, when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund, the\\r\\nyoungest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear little cousin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, with all the gentleness of an\\r\\nexcellent nature, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat can be the matter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And sitting down by her,\\r\\nhe was at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised, and\\r\\npersuade her to speak openly. Was she ill? or was anybody angry with\\r\\nher? or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she puzzled\\r\\nabout anything in her lesson that he could explain? Did she, in short,\\r\\nwant anything he could possibly get her, or do for her? For a long while\\r\\nno answer could be obtained beyond a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno, no--not at all--no, thank\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; but he still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to revert\\r\\nto her own home, than her increased sobs explained to him where the\\r\\ngrievance lay. He tried to console her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich\\r\\nshows you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you are\\r\\nwith relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make you\\r\\nhappy. Let us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all about your\\r\\nbrothers and sisters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all these brothers and\\r\\nsisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in her\\r\\nthoughts than the rest. It was William whom she talked of most, and\\r\\nwanted most to see. William, the eldest, a year older than herself, her\\r\\nconstant companion and friend; her advocate with her mother (of whom\\r\\nhe was the darling) in every distress. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWilliam did not like she should\\r\\ncome away; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut\\r\\nWilliam will write to you, I dare say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, he had promised he would,\\r\\nbut he had told _her_ to write first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd when shall you do it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\nhung her head and answered hesitatingly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe did not know; she had not\\r\\nany paper.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with paper and every\\r\\nother material, and you may write your letter whenever you choose. Would\\r\\nit make you happy to write to William?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen let it be done now. Come with me into the breakfast-room, we shall\\r\\nfind everything there, and be sure of having the room to ourselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, cousin, will it go to the post?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and,\\r\\nas your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy uncle!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, when you have written the letter, I will take it to my father to\\r\\nfrank.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further resistance; and\\r\\nthey went together into the breakfast-room, where Edmund prepared her\\r\\npaper, and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother\\r\\ncould himself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness. He\\r\\ncontinued with her the whole time of her writing, to assist her with his\\r\\npenknife or his orthography, as either were wanted; and added to these\\r\\nattentions, which she felt very much, a kindness to her brother which\\r\\ndelighted her beyond all the rest. He wrote with his own hand his\\r\\nlove to his cousin William, and sent him half a guinea under the seal.\\r\\nFanny's feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself\\r\\nincapable of expressing; but her countenance and a few artless words\\r\\nfully conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her cousin began\\r\\nto find her an interesting object. He talked to her more, and, from all\\r\\nthat she said, was convinced of her having an affectionate heart, and\\r\\na strong desire of doing right; and he could perceive her to be farther\\r\\nentitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation, and great\\r\\ntimidity. He had never knowingly given her pain, but he now felt that\\r\\nshe required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured,\\r\\nin the first place, to lessen her fears of them all, and gave her\\r\\nespecially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and\\r\\nJulia, and being as merry as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this day Fanny grew more comfortable. She felt that she had a\\r\\nfriend, and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits\\r\\nwith everybody else. The place became less strange, and the people less\\r\\nformidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not cease\\r\\nto fear, she began at least to know their ways, and to catch the best\\r\\nmanner of conforming to them. The little rusticities and awkwardnesses\\r\\nwhich had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all,\\r\\nand not least of herself, necessarily wore away, and she was no longer\\r\\nmaterially afraid to appear before her uncle, nor did her aunt Norris's\\r\\nvoice make her start very much. To her cousins she became occasionally\\r\\nan acceptable companion. Though unworthy, from inferiority of age and\\r\\nstrength, to be their constant associate, their pleasures and schemes\\r\\nwere sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful, especially when\\r\\nthat third was of an obliging, yielding temper; and they could not but\\r\\nown, when their aunt inquired into her faults, or their brother Edmund\\r\\nurged her claims to their kindness, that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny was good-natured\\r\\nenough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing worse to endure\\r\\non the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of\\r\\nseventeen will always think fair with a child of ten. He was just\\r\\nentering into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal\\r\\ndispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only for expense and\\r\\nenjoyment. His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his\\r\\nsituation and rights: he made her some very pretty presents, and laughed\\r\\nat her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris\\r\\nthought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it\\r\\nwas pretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, she\\r\\nshowed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them little\\r\\ntrouble. A mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_.\\r\\nFanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught nothing more;\\r\\nand as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had\\r\\nbeen long familiar, they thought her prodigiously stupid, and for the\\r\\nfirst two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of\\r\\nit into the drawing-room. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear mama, only think, my cousin cannot\\r\\nput the map of Europe together--or my cousin cannot tell the principal\\r\\nrivers in Russia--or, she never heard of Asia Minor--or she does\\r\\nnot know the difference between water-colours and crayons!--How\\r\\nstrange!--Did you ever hear anything so stupid?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d their considerate aunt would reply, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is very bad, but\\r\\nyou must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as\\r\\nyourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!--Do you know, we asked her\\r\\nlast night which way she would go to get to Ireland; and she said, she\\r\\nshould cross to the Isle of Wight. She thinks of nothing but the Isle of\\r\\nWight, and she calls it _the_ _Island_, as if there were no other island\\r\\nin the world. I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself, if I had\\r\\nnot known better long before I was so old as she is. I cannot remember\\r\\nthe time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the least\\r\\nnotion of yet. How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat the\\r\\nchronological order of the kings of England, with the dates of their\\r\\naccession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added the other; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand of the Roman emperors as low as Severus;\\r\\nbesides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals,\\r\\nsemi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful\\r\\nmemories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is a\\r\\nvast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else,\\r\\nand therefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her\\r\\ndeficiency. And remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever\\r\\nyourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you know already,\\r\\nthere is a great deal more for you to learn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you another\\r\\nthing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she says she does not\\r\\nwant to learn either music or drawing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great\\r\\nwant of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I do not know\\r\\nwhether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know\\r\\n(owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with\\r\\nyou, it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as\\r\\nyou are;--on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there should\\r\\nbe a difference.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her nieces'\\r\\nminds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their promising\\r\\ntalents and early information, they should be entirely deficient in the\\r\\nless common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity and humility. In\\r\\neverything but disposition they were admirably taught. Sir Thomas did\\r\\nnot know what was wanting, because, though a truly anxious father, he\\r\\nwas not outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of his manner repressed\\r\\nall the flow of their spirits before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest\\r\\nattention. She had not time for such cares. She was a woman who spent\\r\\nher days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece of\\r\\nneedlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her pug than\\r\\nher children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put\\r\\nherself to inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas,\\r\\nand in smaller concerns by her sister. Had she possessed greater leisure\\r\\nfor the service of her girls, she would probably have supposed it\\r\\nunnecessary, for they were under the care of a governess, with proper\\r\\nmasters, and could want nothing more. As for Fanny's being stupid at\\r\\nlearning, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe could only say it was very unlucky, but some people\\r\\n_were_ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains: she did not know what\\r\\nelse was to be done; and, except her being so dull, she must add she saw\\r\\nno harm in the poor little thing, and always found her very handy and\\r\\nquick in carrying messages, and fetching what she wanted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at\\r\\nMansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her\\r\\nattachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among her\\r\\ncousins. There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and though\\r\\nFanny was often mortified by their treatment of her, she thought too\\r\\nlowly of her own claims to feel injured by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom about the time of her entering the family, Lady Bertram, in\\r\\nconsequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gave\\r\\nup the house in town, which she had been used to occupy every spring,\\r\\nand remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend his\\r\\nduty in Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfort\\r\\nmight arise from her absence. In the country, therefore, the Miss\\r\\nBertrams continued to exercise their memories, practise their duets,\\r\\nand grow tall and womanly: and their father saw them becoming in person,\\r\\nmanner, and accomplishments, everything that could satisfy his anxiety.\\r\\nHis eldest son was careless and extravagant, and had already given him\\r\\nmuch uneasiness; but his other children promised him nothing but good.\\r\\nHis daughters, he felt, while they retained the name of Bertram, must\\r\\nbe giving it new grace, and in quitting it, he trusted, would extend\\r\\nits respectable alliances; and the character of Edmund, his strong good\\r\\nsense and uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for utility, honour, and\\r\\nhappiness to himself and all his connexions. He was to be a clergyman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested,\\r\\nSir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs.\\r\\nPrice: he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her\\r\\nsons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny,\\r\\nthough almost totally separated from her family, was sensible of the\\r\\ntruest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them, or of\\r\\nanything at all promising in their situation or conduct. Once, and once\\r\\nonly, in the course of many years, had she the happiness of being with\\r\\nWilliam. Of the rest she saw nothing: nobody seemed to think of her ever\\r\\ngoing amongst them again, even for a visit, nobody at home seemed to\\r\\nwant her; but William determining, soon after her removal, to be a\\r\\nsailor, was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshire\\r\\nbefore he went to sea. Their eager affection in meeting, their exquisite\\r\\ndelight in being together, their hours of happy mirth, and moments of\\r\\nserious conference, may be imagined; as well as the sanguine views and\\r\\nspirits of the boy even to the last, and the misery of the girl when he\\r\\nleft her. Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas holidays, when she\\r\\ncould directly look for comfort to her cousin Edmund; and he told her\\r\\nsuch charming things of what William was to do, and be hereafter, in\\r\\nconsequence of his profession, as made her gradually admit that the\\r\\nseparation might have some use. Edmund's friendship never failed her:\\r\\nhis leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind dispositions, and\\r\\nonly afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them. Without any\\r\\ndisplay of doing more than the rest, or any fear of doing too much,\\r\\nhe was always true to her interests, and considerate of her feelings,\\r\\ntrying to make her good qualities understood, and to conquer the\\r\\ndiffidence which prevented their being more apparent; giving her advice,\\r\\nconsolation, and encouragement.\\r\\n\\r\\nKept back as she was by everybody else, his single support could not\\r\\nbring her forward; but his attentions were otherwise of the highest\\r\\nimportance in assisting the improvement of her mind, and extending its\\r\\npleasures. He knew her to be clever, to have a quick apprehension\\r\\nas well as good sense, and a fondness for reading, which, properly\\r\\ndirected, must be an education in itself. Miss Lee taught her French,\\r\\nand heard her read the daily portion of history; but he recommended\\r\\nthe books which charmed her leisure hours, he encouraged her taste, and\\r\\ncorrected her judgment: he made reading useful by talking to her of what\\r\\nshe read, and heightened its attraction by judicious praise. In return\\r\\nfor such services she loved him better than anybody in the world except\\r\\nWilliam: her heart was divided between the two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr.\\r\\nNorris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and necessarily\\r\\nintroduced alterations and novelties. Mrs. Norris, on quitting the\\r\\nParsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house\\r\\nof Sir Thomas's in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of her\\r\\nhusband by considering that she could do very well without him; and for\\r\\nher reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his uncle died a few years\\r\\nsooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he\\r\\nwere old enough for orders. But Tom's extravagance had, previous to\\r\\nthat event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the next\\r\\npresentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for the\\r\\npleasures of the elder. There was another family living actually held\\r\\nfor Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement\\r\\nsomewhat easier to Sir Thomas's conscience, he could not but feel it to\\r\\nbe an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son\\r\\nwith the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better effect\\r\\nthan anything he had yet been able to say or do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI blush for you, Tom,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, in his most dignified manner; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI blush\\r\\nfor the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity your\\r\\nfeelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten,\\r\\ntwenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income\\r\\nwhich ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours\\r\\n(I hope it will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not\\r\\nbe forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his\\r\\nnatural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent\\r\\nfor the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the\\r\\nurgency of your debts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTom listened with some shame and some sorrow; but escaping as quickly as\\r\\npossible, could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly, that he\\r\\nhad not been half so much in debt as some of his friends; secondly, that\\r\\nhis father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it; and,\\r\\nthirdly, that the future incumbent, whoever he might be, would, in all\\r\\nprobability, die very soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Mr. Norris's death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant,\\r\\nwho came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be a\\r\\nhearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram's\\r\\ncalculations. But \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno, he was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of fellow,\\r\\nand, plied well with good things, would soon pop off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had a wife about fifteen years his junior, but no children; and\\r\\nthey entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very\\r\\nrespectable, agreeable people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law to\\r\\nclaim her share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris's situation,\\r\\nand the improvement in Fanny's age, seeming not merely to do away any\\r\\nformer objection to their living together, but even to give it the most\\r\\ndecided eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered less\\r\\nfair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate, in\\r\\naddition to his eldest son's extravagance, it became not undesirable\\r\\nto himself to be relieved from the expense of her support, and the\\r\\nobligation of her future provision. In the fullness of his belief that\\r\\nsuch a thing must be, he mentioned its probability to his wife; and the\\r\\nfirst time of the subject's occurring to her again happening to be when\\r\\nFanny was present, she calmly observed to her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, Fanny, you are going\\r\\nto leave us, and live with my sister. How shall you like it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt's words,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoing to leave you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, my dear; why should you be astonished? You have been five years\\r\\nwith us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died.\\r\\nBut you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected. She had\\r\\nnever received kindness from her aunt Norris, and could not love her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be very sorry to go away,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, with a faltering voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I dare say you will; _that's_ natural enough. I suppose you have\\r\\nhad as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature\\r\\nin the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny modestly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear; I hope not. I have always found you a very good girl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd am I never to live here again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. It can make\\r\\nvery little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the\\r\\nother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel the\\r\\ndifference to be so small, she could not think of living with her aunt\\r\\nwith anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she told\\r\\nhim her distress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCousin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csomething is going to happen which I do not like\\r\\nat all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to\\r\\nthings that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now. I am\\r\\ngoing to live entirely with my aunt Norris.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so. It is quite settled. I am to\\r\\nleave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon as\\r\\nshe is removed there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should call\\r\\nit an excellent one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, cousin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a sensible\\r\\nwoman in wishing for you. She is choosing a friend and companion exactly\\r\\nwhere she ought, and I am glad her love of money does not interfere.\\r\\nYou will be what you ought to be to her. I hope it does not distress you\\r\\nvery much, Fanny?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything in\\r\\nit: I shall love nothing there. You know how uncomfortable I feel with\\r\\nher.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can say nothing for her manner to you as a child; but it was the\\r\\nsame with us all, or nearly so. She never knew how to be pleasant to\\r\\nchildren. But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she is\\r\\nbehaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you _must_\\r\\nbe important to her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can never be important to any one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is to prevent you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, you\\r\\nnever have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly.\\r\\nThere is no reason in the world why you should not be important where\\r\\nyou are known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure\\r\\nyou have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without\\r\\nwishing to return it. I do not know any better qualifications for a\\r\\nfriend and companion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are too kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, colouring at such praise; \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow shall I\\r\\never thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me. Oh! cousin, if I\\r\\nam to go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my\\r\\nlife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distance\\r\\nas the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred miles\\r\\noff instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost\\r\\nas much as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in the\\r\\nyear. The only difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will\\r\\nnecessarily be brought forward as you ought to be. _Here_ there are\\r\\ntoo many whom you can hide behind; but with _her_ you will be forced to\\r\\nspeak for yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! I do not say so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must say it, and say it with pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much better\\r\\nfitted than my mother for having the charge of you now. She is of a\\r\\ntemper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself\\r\\nabout, and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny sighed, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot see things as you do; but I ought to\\r\\nbelieve you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obliged\\r\\nto you for trying to reconcile me to what must be. If I could suppose\\r\\nmy aunt really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself of\\r\\nconsequence to anybody. _Here_, I know, I am of none, and yet I love the\\r\\nplace so well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the house.\\r\\nYou will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever. Even\\r\\n_your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal\\r\\nchange. You will have the same walks to frequent, the same library to\\r\\nchoose from, the same people to look at, the same horse to ride.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true. Yes, dear old grey pony! Ah! cousin, when I remember how\\r\\nmuch I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talked\\r\\nof as likely to do me good (oh! how I have trembled at my uncle's\\r\\nopening his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind\\r\\npains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince\\r\\nme that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right you\\r\\nproved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as\\r\\ngood for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for\\r\\nyour ultimate happiness too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it\\r\\ncould render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had\\r\\nnot the smallest intention of taking her. It had never occurred to her,\\r\\non the present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. To\\r\\nprevent its being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitation\\r\\nwhich could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish,\\r\\nthe White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her\\r\\nservants, and allow a spare room for a friend, of which she made a\\r\\nvery particular point. The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been\\r\\nwanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now\\r\\nnever forgotten. Not all her precautions, however, could save her from\\r\\nbeing suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display of\\r\\nthe importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose\\r\\nit really intended for Fanny. Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a\\r\\ncertainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goes\\r\\nto live with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris almost started. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLive with me, dear Lady Bertram! what do\\r\\nyou mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs she not to live with you? I thought you had settled it with Sir\\r\\nThomas.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe! never. I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he to\\r\\nme. Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think\\r\\nof, or for anybody to wish that really knows us both. Good heaven! what\\r\\ncould I do with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for\\r\\nanything, my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl at\\r\\nher time of life? A girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to need\\r\\nmost attention and care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test!\\r\\nSure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing! Sir Thomas is\\r\\ntoo much my friend. Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure, would propose\\r\\nit. How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I do not know. I suppose he thought it best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what did he say? He could not say he _wished_ me to take Fanny. I\\r\\nam sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought so too. We\\r\\nboth thought it would be a comfort to you. But if you do not like it,\\r\\nthere is no more to be said. She is no encumbrance here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she be any\\r\\ncomfort to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best of\\r\\nhusbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits still\\r\\nworse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to\\r\\nsupport me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as not\\r\\nto disgrace the memory of the dear departed--what possible comfort could\\r\\nI have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny? If I could wish it for\\r\\nmy own sake, I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl. She\\r\\nis in good hands, and sure of doing well. I must struggle through my\\r\\nsorrows and difficulties as I can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLady Bertram, I do not complain. I know I cannot live as I have done,\\r\\nbut I must retrench where I can, and learn to be a better manager. I\\r\\n_have_ _been_ a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed\\r\\nto practise economy now. My situation is as much altered as my income.\\r\\nA great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the\\r\\nparish, that cannot be expected from me. It is unknown how much was\\r\\nconsumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At the White House,\\r\\nmatters must be better looked after. I _must_ live within my income, or\\r\\nI shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to\\r\\nbe able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say you will. You always do, don't you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me.\\r\\nIt is for your children's good that I wish to be richer. I have nobody\\r\\nelse to care for, but I should be very glad to think I could leave a\\r\\nlittle trifle among them worth their having.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them. They are\\r\\nsure of being well provided for. Sir Thomas will take care of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, you know, Sir Thomas's means will be rather straitened if the\\r\\nAntigua estate is to make such poor returns.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! _that_ will soon be settled. Sir Thomas has been writing about it,\\r\\nI know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Lady Bertram,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can only say\\r\\nthat my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir\\r\\nThomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able\\r\\nto say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;\\r\\nbesides that, I really should not have a bed to give her, for I must\\r\\nkeep a spare room for a friend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to\\r\\nconvince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law's views; and\\r\\nshe was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the\\r\\nslightest allusion to it from him. He could not but wonder at her\\r\\nrefusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to\\r\\nadopt; but, as she took early care to make him, as well as Lady Bertram,\\r\\nunderstand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family,\\r\\nhe soon grew reconciled to a distinction which, at the same time that it\\r\\nwas advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable him better to\\r\\nprovide for Fanny himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal;\\r\\nand her spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some\\r\\nconsolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to\\r\\nbe so essentially serviceable to her. Mrs. Norris took possession of the\\r\\nWhite House, the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events over,\\r\\neverything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable, gave great\\r\\nsatisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance. They had their\\r\\nfaults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out. The Doctor was very fond of\\r\\neating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant, instead\\r\\nof contriving to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook as high\\r\\nwages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seen in her\\r\\noffices. Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances,\\r\\nnor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed\\r\\nin the house. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself;\\r\\nnobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she believed, had never\\r\\nbeen wanting in comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad character\\r\\nin _her_ _time_, but this was a way of going on that she could not\\r\\nunderstand. A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place.\\r\\n_Her_ store-room, she thought, might have been good enough for Mrs.\\r\\nGrant to go into. Inquire where she would, she could not find out that\\r\\nMrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective.\\r\\nShe could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she felt all\\r\\nthe injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant's being so well settled in life\\r\\nwithout being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on that point\\r\\nalmost as often, though not so diffusely, as Mrs. Norris discussed the\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event\\r\\narose of such importance in the family, as might fairly claim some place\\r\\nin the thoughts and conversation of the ladies. Sir Thomas found it\\r\\nexpedient to go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement of his\\r\\naffairs, and he took his eldest son with him, in the hope of detaching\\r\\nhim from some bad connexions at home. They left England with the\\r\\nprobability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of its\\r\\nutility to his son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the\\r\\nrest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction of\\r\\nothers at their present most interesting time of life. He could not\\r\\nthink Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or rather,\\r\\nto perform what should have been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris's watchful\\r\\nattention, and in Edmund's judgment, he had sufficient confidence to\\r\\nmake him go without fears for their conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her; but she\\r\\nwas not disturbed by any alarm for his safety, or solicitude for his\\r\\ncomfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous,\\r\\nor difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion: not for their\\r\\nsorrow, but for their want of it. Their father was no object of love to\\r\\nthem; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his absence\\r\\nwas unhappily most welcome. They were relieved by it from all restraint;\\r\\nand without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been\\r\\nforbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at their\\r\\nown disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach. Fanny's\\r\\nrelief, and her consciousness of it, were quite equal to her cousins';\\r\\nbut a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful,\\r\\nand she really grieved because she could not grieve. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas, who\\r\\nhad done so much for her and her brothers, and who was gone perhaps\\r\\nnever to return! that she should see him go without a tear! it was a\\r\\nshameful insensibility.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He had said to her, moreover, on the very last\\r\\nmorning, that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the\\r\\nensuing winter, and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield\\r\\nas soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be\\r\\nin England. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was so thoughtful and kind!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and would he only have\\r\\nsmiled upon her, and called her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy dear Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while he said it, every\\r\\nformer frown or cold address might have been forgotten. But he had ended\\r\\nhis speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification, by adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf\\r\\nWilliam does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able to convince him\\r\\nthat the many years which have passed since you parted have not been\\r\\nspent on your side entirely without improvement; though, I fear, he must\\r\\nfind his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at\\r\\nten.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was\\r\\ngone; and her cousins, on seeing her with red eyes, set her down as a\\r\\nhypocrite.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he\\r\\ncould be only nominally missed; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished\\r\\nto find how very well they did even without his father, how well Edmund\\r\\ncould supply his place in carving, talking to the steward, writing to\\r\\nthe attorney, settling with the servants, and equally saving her\\r\\nfrom all possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of\\r\\ndirecting her letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest intelligence of the travellers' safe arrival at Antigua,\\r\\nafter a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris\\r\\nhad been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund\\r\\nparticipate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended\\r\\non being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,\\r\\nshe had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,\\r\\nwhen Sir Thomas's assurances of their both being alive and well made it\\r\\nnecessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches\\r\\nfor a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winter came and passed without their being called for; the accounts\\r\\ncontinued perfectly good; and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for her\\r\\nnieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments,\\r\\nand looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, in\\r\\naddition to all her own household cares, some interference in those of\\r\\nher sister, and Mrs. Grant's wasteful doings to overlook, left her very\\r\\nlittle occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the\\r\\nneighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements\\r\\na manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to general civility and\\r\\nobligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration. Their\\r\\nvanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it,\\r\\nand gave themselves no airs; while the praises attending such behaviour,\\r\\nsecured and brought round by their aunt, served to strengthen them in\\r\\nbelieving they had no faults.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters. She was too\\r\\nindolent even to accept a mother's gratification in witnessing their\\r\\nsuccess and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble, and the\\r\\ncharge was made over to her sister, who desired nothing better than a\\r\\npost of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly relished\\r\\nthe means it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses to\\r\\nhire.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyed\\r\\nbeing avowedly useful as her aunt's companion when they called away the\\r\\nrest of the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she naturally\\r\\nbecame everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party.\\r\\nShe talked to her, listened to her, read to her; and the tranquillity\\r\\nof such evenings, her perfect security in such a _tete-a-tete_ from any\\r\\nsound of unkindness, was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom\\r\\nknown a pause in its alarms or embarrassments. As to her cousins'\\r\\ngaieties, she loved to hear an account of them, especially of the\\r\\nballs, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thought too lowly of her\\r\\nown situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same, and\\r\\nlistened, therefore, without an idea of any nearer concern in them. Upon\\r\\nthe whole, it was a comfortable winter to her; for though it brought\\r\\nno William to England, the never-failing hope of his arrival was worth\\r\\nmuch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend, the old grey pony;\\r\\nand for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health as\\r\\nwell as in her affections; for in spite of the acknowledged importance\\r\\nof her riding on horse-back, no measures were taken for mounting her\\r\\nagain, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as it was observed by her aunts, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe might ride one\\r\\nof her cousin's horses at any time when they did not want them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and as\\r\\nthe Miss Bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day, and had\\r\\nno idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real\\r\\npleasure, that time, of course, never came. They took their cheerful\\r\\nrides in the fine mornings of April and May; and Fanny either sat at\\r\\nhome the whole day with one aunt, or walked beyond her strength at\\r\\nthe instigation of the other: Lady Bertram holding exercise to be as\\r\\nunnecessary for everybody as it was unpleasant to herself; and Mrs.\\r\\nNorris, who was walking all day, thinking everybody ought to walk\\r\\nas much. Edmund was absent at this time, or the evil would have\\r\\nbeen earlier remedied. When he returned, to understand how Fanny was\\r\\nsituated, and perceived its ill effects, there seemed with him but one\\r\\nthing to be done; and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny must have a horse\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the resolute\\r\\ndeclaration with which he opposed whatever could be urged by the\\r\\nsupineness of his mother, or the economy of his aunt, to make it appear\\r\\nunimportant. Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some steady old\\r\\nthing might be found among the numbers belonging to the Park that would\\r\\ndo vastly well; or that one might be borrowed of the steward; or that\\r\\nperhaps Dr. Grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to the\\r\\npost. She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary, and even\\r\\nimproper, that Fanny should have a regular lady's horse of her own, in\\r\\nthe style of her cousins. She was sure Sir Thomas had never intended it:\\r\\nand she must say that, to be making such a purchase in his absence, and\\r\\nadding to the great expenses of his stable, at a time when a large part\\r\\nof his income was unsettled, seemed to her very unjustifiable. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny\\r\\nmust have a horse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Edmund's only reply. Mrs. Norris could not see\\r\\nit in the same light. Lady Bertram did: she entirely agreed with her son\\r\\nas to the necessity of it, and as to its being considered necessary by\\r\\nhis father; she only pleaded against there being any hurry; she only\\r\\nwanted him to wait till Sir Thomas's return, and then Sir Thomas might\\r\\nsettle it all himself. He would be at home in September, and where would\\r\\nbe the harm of only waiting till September?\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his\\r\\nmother, as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not help paying\\r\\nmore attention to what she said; and at length determined on a method of\\r\\nproceeding which would obviate the risk of his father's thinking he\\r\\nhad done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny the immediate\\r\\nmeans of exercise, which he could not bear she should be without. He had\\r\\nthree horses of his own, but not one that would carry a woman. Two\\r\\nof them were hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this third he\\r\\nresolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride; he knew where\\r\\nsuch a one was to be met with; and having once made up his mind, the\\r\\nwhole business was soon completed. The new mare proved a treasure; with\\r\\na very little trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose,\\r\\nand Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her. She had not\\r\\nsupposed before that anything could ever suit her like the old grey\\r\\npony; but her delight in Edmund's mare was far beyond any former\\r\\npleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving in the\\r\\nconsideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung, was\\r\\nbeyond all her words to express. She regarded her cousin as an example\\r\\nof everything good and great, as possessing worth which no one but\\r\\nherself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude from\\r\\nher as no feelings could be strong enough to pay. Her sentiments towards\\r\\nhim were compounded of all that was respectful, grateful, confiding, and\\r\\ntender.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of Edmund,\\r\\nMrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny's use; and had Lady\\r\\nBertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might have\\r\\nbeen excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas's return in\\r\\nSeptember, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and\\r\\nwithout any near prospect of finishing his business. Unfavourable\\r\\ncircumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to\\r\\nturn all his thoughts towards England; and the very great uncertainty\\r\\nin which everything was then involved determined him on sending home his\\r\\nson, and waiting the final arrangement by himself. Tom arrived safely,\\r\\nbringing an excellent account of his father's health; but to very little\\r\\npurpose, as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned. Sir Thomas's sending away\\r\\nhis son seemed to her so like a parent's care, under the influence of a\\r\\nforeboding of evil to himself, that she could not help feeling dreadful\\r\\npresentiments; and as the long evenings of autumn came on, was so\\r\\nterribly haunted by these ideas, in the sad solitariness of her cottage,\\r\\nas to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-room of the Park.\\r\\nThe return of winter engagements, however, was not without its effect;\\r\\nand in the course of their progress, her mind became so pleasantly\\r\\noccupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest niece, as\\r\\ntolerably to quiet her nerves. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf poor Sir Thomas were fated never to\\r\\nreturn, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well\\r\\nmarried,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she very often thought; always when they were in the company\\r\\nof men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a young man\\r\\nwho had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest\\r\\nplaces in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram,\\r\\nand, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love. He was\\r\\na heavy young man, with not more than common sense; but as there was\\r\\nnothing disagreeable in his figure or address, the young lady was well\\r\\npleased with her conquest. Being now in her twenty-first year, Maria\\r\\nBertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a marriage with\\r\\nMr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her\\r\\nfather's, as well as ensure her the house in town, which was now a prime\\r\\nobject, it became, by the same rule of moral obligation, her evident\\r\\nduty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could. Mrs. Norris was most zealous\\r\\nin promoting the match, by every suggestion and contrivance likely to\\r\\nenhance its desirableness to either party; and, among other means, by\\r\\nseeking an intimacy with the gentleman's mother, who at present lived\\r\\nwith him, and to whom she even forced Lady Bertram to go through ten\\r\\nmiles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit. It was not long before\\r\\na good understanding took place between this lady and herself. Mrs.\\r\\nRushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry,\\r\\nand declared that of all the young ladies she had ever seen, Miss\\r\\nBertram seemed, by her amiable qualities and accomplishments, the best\\r\\nadapted to make him happy. Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment,\\r\\nand admired the nice discernment of character which could so well\\r\\ndistinguish merit. Maria was indeed the pride and delight of them\\r\\nall--perfectly faultless--an angel; and, of course, so surrounded by\\r\\nadmirers, must be difficult in her choice: but yet, as far as Mrs.\\r\\nNorris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance, Mr.\\r\\nRushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young\\r\\npeople justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due reference\\r\\nto the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfaction\\r\\nof their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of the\\r\\nneighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency of Mr.\\r\\nRushworth's marrying Miss Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some months before Sir Thomas's consent could be received; but,\\r\\nin the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure\\r\\nin the connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried\\r\\non without restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs.\\r\\nNorris's talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at\\r\\npresent.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the\\r\\nbusiness; but no representation of his aunt's could induce him to find\\r\\nMr. Rushworth a desirable companion. He could allow his sister to be\\r\\nthe best judge of her own happiness, but he was not pleased that her\\r\\nhappiness should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain from\\r\\noften saying to himself, in Mr. Rushworth's company--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf this man had\\r\\nnot twelve thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance\\r\\nso unquestionably advantageous, and of which he heard nothing but the\\r\\nperfectly good and agreeable. It was a connexion exactly of the right\\r\\nsort--in the same county, and the same interest--and his most hearty\\r\\nconcurrence was conveyed as soon as possible. He only conditioned that\\r\\nthe marriage should not take place before his return, which he was again\\r\\nlooking eagerly forward to. He wrote in April, and had strong hopes\\r\\nof settling everything to his entire satisfaction, and leaving Antigua\\r\\nbefore the end of the summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just\\r\\nreached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received\\r\\nan addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss\\r\\nCrawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage. They were\\r\\nyoung people of fortune. The son had a good estate in Norfolk, the\\r\\ndaughter twenty thousand pounds. As children, their sister had been\\r\\nalways very fond of them; but, as her own marriage had been soon\\r\\nfollowed by the death of their common parent, which left them to the\\r\\ncare of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she\\r\\nhad scarcely seen them since. In their uncle's house they had found a\\r\\nkind home. Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else,\\r\\nwere united in affection for these children, or, at least, were no\\r\\nfarther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite, to\\r\\nwhom they showed the greatest fondness of the two. The Admiral delighted\\r\\nin the boy, Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl; and it was the lady's death\\r\\nwhich now obliged her _protegee_, after some months' further trial at\\r\\nher uncle's house, to find another home. Admiral Crawford was a man of\\r\\nvicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaining his niece, to bring his\\r\\nmistress under his own roof; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted for her\\r\\nsister's proposal of coming to her, a measure quite as welcome on one\\r\\nside as it could be expedient on the other; for Mrs. Grant, having by\\r\\nthis time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the\\r\\ncountry without a family of children--having more than filled her\\r\\nfavourite sitting-room with pretty furniture, and made a choice\\r\\ncollection of plants and poultry--was very much in want of some variety\\r\\nat home. The arrival, therefore, of a sister whom she had always loved,\\r\\nand now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained single, was\\r\\nhighly agreeable; and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should not\\r\\nsatisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to London.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions, though\\r\\nthey arose principally from doubts of her sister's style of living and\\r\\ntone of society; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to\\r\\npersuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house,\\r\\nthat she could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations. To\\r\\nanything like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, Henry\\r\\nCrawford had, unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate his\\r\\nsister in an article of such importance; but he escorted her, with the\\r\\nutmost kindness, into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetch\\r\\nher away again, at half an hour's notice, whenever she were weary of the\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meeting was very satisfactory on each side. Miss Crawford found a\\r\\nsister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister's husband who looked\\r\\nthe gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grant\\r\\nreceived in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man\\r\\nand woman of very prepossessing appearance. Mary Crawford was remarkably\\r\\npretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance; the manners\\r\\nof both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them\\r\\ncredit for everything else. She was delighted with each, but Mary was\\r\\nher dearest object; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her\\r\\nown, she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister's.\\r\\nShe had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her:\\r\\nshe had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest son of a baronet was not too\\r\\ngood for a girl of twenty thousand pounds, with all the elegance\\r\\nand accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her; and being a\\r\\nwarm-hearted, unreserved woman, Mary had not been three hours in the\\r\\nhouse before she told her what she had planned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near\\r\\nthem, and not at all displeased either at her sister's early care, or\\r\\nthe choice it had fallen on. Matrimony was her object, provided she\\r\\ncould marry well: and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she knew that\\r\\nobjection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in\\r\\nlife. While she treated it as a joke, therefore, she did not forget to\\r\\nthink of it seriously. The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Mrs. Grant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have thought of something to make it\\r\\ncomplete. I should dearly love to settle you both in this country; and\\r\\ntherefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice,\\r\\nhandsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very\\r\\nhappy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry bowed and thanked her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear sister,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mary, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you can persuade him into anything\\r\\nof the sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself\\r\\nallied to anybody so clever, and I shall only regret that you have\\r\\nnot half a dozen daughters to dispose of. If you can persuade Henry\\r\\nto marry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman. All that English\\r\\nabilities can do has been tried already. I have three very particular\\r\\nfriends who have been all dying for him in their turn; and the pains\\r\\nwhich they, their mothers (very clever women), as well as my dear aunt\\r\\nand myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick him into marrying, is\\r\\ninconceivable! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined. If\\r\\nyour Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke, let them\\r\\navoid Henry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear brother, I will not believe this of you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I am sure you are too good. You will be kinder than Mary. You\\r\\nwill allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience. I am of a cautious\\r\\ntemper, and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry. Nobody can\\r\\nthink more highly of the matrimonial state than myself. I consider the\\r\\nblessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of\\r\\nthe poet--'Heaven's _last_ best gift.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere, Mrs. Grant, you see how he dwells on one word, and only look\\r\\nat his smile. I assure you he is very detestable; the Admiral's lessons\\r\\nhave quite spoiled him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI pay very little regard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Grant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto what any young person\\r\\nsays on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination for\\r\\nit, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no\\r\\ndisinclination to the state herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes! I am not at all ashamed of it. I would have everybody marry if\\r\\nthey can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselves\\r\\naway; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to\\r\\nadvantage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young people were pleased with each other from the first. On each\\r\\nside there was much to attract, and their acquaintance soon promised as\\r\\nearly an intimacy as good manners would warrant. Miss Crawford's beauty\\r\\ndid her no disservice with the Miss Bertrams. They were too handsome\\r\\nthemselves to dislike any woman for being so too, and were almost as\\r\\nmuch charmed as their brothers with her lively dark eye, clear brown\\r\\ncomplexion, and general prettiness. Had she been tall, full formed, and\\r\\nfair, it might have been more of a trial: but as it was, there could be\\r\\nno comparison; and she was most allowably a sweet, pretty girl, while\\r\\nthey were the finest young women in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer brother was not handsome: no, when they first saw him he was\\r\\nabsolutely plain, black and plain; but still he was the gentleman, with\\r\\na pleasing address. The second meeting proved him not so very plain:\\r\\nhe was plain, to be sure, but then he had so much countenance, and his\\r\\nteeth were so good, and he was so well made, that one soon forgot he was\\r\\nplain; and after a third interview, after dining in company with him at\\r\\nthe Parsonage, he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody. He\\r\\nwas, in fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known,\\r\\nand they were equally delighted with him. Miss Bertram's engagement made\\r\\nhim in equity the property of Julia, of which Julia was fully aware; and\\r\\nbefore he had been at Mansfield a week, she was quite ready to be fallen\\r\\nin love with.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria's notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct. She\\r\\ndid not want to see or understand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere could be no harm in her liking\\r\\nan agreeable man--everybody knew her situation--Mr. Crawford must take\\r\\ncare of himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger! the\\r\\nMiss Bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready to be pleased; and he\\r\\nbegan with no object but of making them like him. He did not want them\\r\\nto die of love; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him\\r\\njudge and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude on such points.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, as he returned\\r\\nfrom attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey\\r\\nare very elegant, agreeable girls.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it. But you like\\r\\nJulia best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes! I like Julia best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the\\r\\nhandsomest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I should suppose. She has the advantage in every feature, and I\\r\\nprefer her countenance; but I like Julia best; Miss Bertram is certainly\\r\\nthe handsomest, and I have found her the most agreeable, but I shall\\r\\nalways like Julia best, because you order me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you _will_ like her best at\\r\\nlast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not I tell you that I like her best _at_ _first_?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd besides, Miss Bertram is engaged. Remember that, my dear brother.\\r\\nHer choice is made.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and I like her the better for it. An engaged woman is always more\\r\\nagreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her cares\\r\\nare over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing\\r\\nwithout suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be\\r\\ndone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and it\\r\\nis a great match for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him; _that_ is your\\r\\nopinion of your intimate friend. _I_ do not subscribe to it. I am sure\\r\\nMiss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth. I could see it in\\r\\nher eyes, when he was mentioned. I think too well of Miss Bertram to\\r\\nsuppose she would ever give her hand without her heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMary, how shall we manage him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must leave him to himself, I believe. Talking does no good. He will\\r\\nbe taken in at last.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I would not have him _taken_ _in_; I would not have him duped; I\\r\\nwould have it all fair and honourable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in. It will do just as\\r\\nwell. Everybody is taken in at some period or other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot always in marriage, dear Mary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn marriage especially. With all due respect to such of the present\\r\\ncompany as chance to be married, my dear Mrs. Grant, there is not one in\\r\\na hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry. Look where\\r\\nI will, I see that it _is_ so; and I feel that it _must_ be so, when I\\r\\nconsider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people expect\\r\\nmost from others, and are least honest themselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but,\\r\\nhowever, speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring business.\\r\\nI know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence\\r\\nof some one particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, or\\r\\ngood quality in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived,\\r\\nand been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse. What is this but a\\r\\ntake in?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear child, there must be a little imagination here. I beg your\\r\\npardon, but I cannot quite believe you. Depend upon it, you see but\\r\\nhalf. You see the evil, but you do not see the consolation. There will\\r\\nbe little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to\\r\\nexpect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human\\r\\nnature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make\\r\\na second better: we find comfort somewhere--and those evil-minded\\r\\nobservers, dearest Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken in\\r\\nand deceived than the parties themselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell done, sister! I honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_. When I am a\\r\\nwife, I mean to be just as staunch myself; and I wish my friends in\\r\\ngeneral would be so too. It would save me many a heartache.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure you both.\\r\\nMansfield shall cure you both, and without any taking in. Stay with us,\\r\\nand we will cure you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very willing to stay.\\r\\nMary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home, and Henry\\r\\nequally ready to lengthen his visit. He had come, intending to spend\\r\\nonly a few days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there was\\r\\nnothing to call him elsewhere. It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both\\r\\nwith her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so: a\\r\\ntalking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society\\r\\nto an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford's being his guest was\\r\\nan excuse for drinking claret every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miss Bertrams' admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than\\r\\nanything which Miss Crawford's habits made her likely to feel. She\\r\\nacknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men,\\r\\nthat two such young men were not often seen together even in London, and\\r\\nthat their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good.\\r\\n_He_ had been much in London, and had more liveliness and gallantry than\\r\\nEdmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being the\\r\\neldest was another strong claim. She had felt an early presentiment that\\r\\nshe _should_ like the eldest best. She knew it was her way.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate; he was\\r\\nthe sort of young man to be generally liked, his agreeableness was of\\r\\nthe kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher\\r\\nstamp, for he had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance,\\r\\nand a great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield Park, and a\\r\\nbaronetcy, did no harm to all this. Miss Crawford soon felt that he and\\r\\nhis situation might do. She looked about her with due consideration, and\\r\\nfound almost everything in his favour: a park, a real park, five miles\\r\\nround, a spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well screened\\r\\nas to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen's\\r\\nseats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be completely new\\r\\nfurnished--pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an agreeable man\\r\\nhimself--with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present\\r\\nby a promise to his father, and of being Sir Thomas hereafter. It\\r\\nmight do very well; she believed she should accept him; and she began\\r\\naccordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to\\r\\nrun at the B---- races.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance\\r\\nbegan; and as it appeared that the family did not, from his usual goings\\r\\non, expect him back again for many weeks, it would bring his passion to\\r\\nan early proof. Much was said on his side to induce her to attend the\\r\\nraces, and schemes were made for a large party to them, with all the\\r\\neagerness of inclination, but it would only do to be talked of.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Fanny, what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while? and what\\r\\nwas _her_ opinion of the newcomers? Few young ladies of eighteen could\\r\\nbe less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny. In a quiet way,\\r\\nvery little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss\\r\\nCrawford's beauty; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford\\r\\nvery plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the\\r\\ncontrary, she never mentioned _him_. The notice, which she excited\\r\\nherself, was to this effect. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI begin now to understand you all,\\r\\nexcept Miss Price,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, as she was walking with the Mr.\\r\\nBertrams. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray, is she out, or is she not? I am puzzled. She dined at\\r\\nthe Parsonage, with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_; and\\r\\nyet she says so little, that I can hardly suppose she _is_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe I know\\r\\nwhat you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question. My\\r\\ncousin is grown up. She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs\\r\\nand not outs are beyond me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. The\\r\\ndistinction is so broad. Manners as well as appearance are, generally\\r\\nspeaking, so totally different. Till now, I could not have supposed it\\r\\npossible to be mistaken as to a girl's being out or not. A girl not out\\r\\nhas always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks\\r\\nvery demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I\\r\\nassure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far,\\r\\nit is all very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most\\r\\nobjectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being\\r\\nintroduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass in\\r\\nsuch very little time from reserve to quite the opposite--to confidence!\\r\\n_That_ is the faulty part of the present system. One does not like to\\r\\nsee a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing--and\\r\\nperhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before. Mr.\\r\\nBertram, I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with such changes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you are at. You\\r\\nare quizzing me and Miss Anderson.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed. Miss Anderson! I do not know who or what you mean. I am\\r\\nquite in the dark. But I _will_ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure,\\r\\nif you will tell me what about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite so far imposed\\r\\non. You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye, in describing an\\r\\naltered young lady. You paint too accurately for mistake. It was exactly\\r\\nso. The Andersons of Baker Street. We were speaking of them the other\\r\\nday, you know. Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles Anderson.\\r\\nThe circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it. When\\r\\nAnderson first introduced me to his family, about two years ago, his\\r\\nsister was not _out_, and I could not get her to speak to me. I sat\\r\\nthere an hour one morning waiting for Anderson, with only her and a\\r\\nlittle girl or two in the room, the governess being sick or run away,\\r\\nand the mother in and out every moment with letters of business, and I\\r\\ncould hardly get a word or a look from the young lady--nothing like a\\r\\ncivil answer--she screwed up her mouth, and turned from me with such an\\r\\nair! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth. She was then _out_. I\\r\\nmet her at Mrs. Holford's, and did not recollect her. She came up to me,\\r\\nclaimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and talked\\r\\nand laughed till I did not know which way to look. I felt that I must\\r\\nbe the jest of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is plain, has\\r\\nheard the story.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, I dare say,\\r\\nthan does credit to Miss Anderson. It is too common a fault. Mothers\\r\\ncertainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their\\r\\ndaughters. I do not know where the error lies. I do not pretend to set\\r\\npeople right, but I do see that they are often wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose who are showing the world what female manners _should_ be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nMr. Bertram gallantly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9care doing a great deal to set them right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe error is plain enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the less courteous Edmund; \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuch girls\\r\\nare ill brought up. They are given wrong notions from the beginning.\\r\\nThey are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no more\\r\\nreal modesty in their behaviour _before_ they appear in public than\\r\\nafterwards.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I cannot\\r\\nagree with you there. It is certainly the modestest part of the\\r\\nbusiness. It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the\\r\\nsame airs and take the same liberties as if they were, which I have seen\\r\\ndone. That is worse than anything--quite disgusting!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, _that_ is very inconvenient indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bertram. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt leads\\r\\none astray; one does not know what to do. The close bonnet and demure\\r\\nair you describe so well (and nothing was ever juster), tell one what\\r\\nis expected; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of\\r\\nthem. I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September,\\r\\njust after my return from the West Indies. My friend Sneyd--you have\\r\\nheard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund--his father, and mother, and sisters,\\r\\nwere there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place they were out;\\r\\nwe went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and the two Miss\\r\\nSneyds, with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow in form; and\\r\\nas Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to one of her\\r\\ndaughters, walked by her side all the way home, and made myself as\\r\\nagreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners, and\\r\\nas ready to talk as to listen. I had not a suspicion that I could be\\r\\ndoing anything wrong. They looked just the same: both well-dressed, with\\r\\nveils and parasols like other girls; but I afterwards found that I had\\r\\nbeen giving all my attention to the youngest, who was not _out_, and\\r\\nhad most excessively offended the eldest. Miss Augusta ought not to have\\r\\nbeen noticed for the next six months; and Miss Sneyd, I believe, has\\r\\nnever forgiven me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was bad indeed. Poor Miss Sneyd. Though I have no younger\\r\\nsister, I feel for her. To be neglected before one's time must be very\\r\\nvexatious; but it was entirely the mother's fault. Miss Augusta should\\r\\nhave been with her governess. Such half-and-half doings never prosper.\\r\\nBut now I must be satisfied about Miss Price. Does she go to balls? Does\\r\\nshe dine out every where, as well as at my sister's?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Edmund; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think she has ever been to a ball. My\\r\\nmother seldom goes into company herself, and dines nowhere but with Mrs.\\r\\nGrant, and Fanny stays at home with _her_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! then the point is clear. Miss Price is not out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bertram set off for--------, and Miss Crawford was prepared to\\r\\nfind a great chasm in their society, and to miss him decidedly in the\\r\\nmeetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families;\\r\\nand on their all dining together at the Park soon after his going, she\\r\\nretook her chosen place near the bottom of the table, fully expecting to\\r\\nfeel a most melancholy difference in the change of masters. It would\\r\\nbe a very flat business, she was sure. In comparison with his brother,\\r\\nEdmund would have nothing to say. The soup would be sent round in a most\\r\\nspiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling,\\r\\nand the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any\\r\\nformer haunch, or a single entertaining story, about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy friend such a\\r\\none.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper\\r\\nend of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth, who was now making his\\r\\nappearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords' arrival.\\r\\nHe had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county, and that\\r\\nfriend having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver, Mr.\\r\\nRushworth was returned with his head full of the subject, and very eager\\r\\nto be improving his own place in the same way; and though not saying\\r\\nmuch to the purpose, could talk of nothing else. The subject had\\r\\nbeen already handled in the drawing-room; it was revived in the\\r\\ndining-parlour. Miss Bertram's attention and opinion was evidently his\\r\\nchief aim; and though her deportment showed rather conscious superiority\\r\\nthan any solicitude to oblige him, the mention of Sotherton Court,\\r\\nand the ideas attached to it, gave her a feeling of complacency, which\\r\\nprevented her from being very ungracious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish you could see Compton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is the most complete thing!\\r\\nI never saw a place so altered in my life. I told Smith I did not know\\r\\nwhere I was. The approach _now_, is one of the finest things in the\\r\\ncountry: you see the house in the most surprising manner. I declare,\\r\\nwhen I got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a prison--quite a\\r\\ndismal old prison.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, for shame!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Norris. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA prison indeed? Sotherton Court is\\r\\nthe noblest old place in the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wants improvement, ma'am, beyond anything. I never saw a place that\\r\\nwanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I do\\r\\nnot know what can be done with it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\nGrant to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut depend upon it, Sotherton will\\r\\nhave _every_ improvement in time which his heart can desire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must try to do something with it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Rushworth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I do not\\r\\nknow what. I hope I shall have some good friend to help me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour best friend upon such an occasion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Bertram calmly,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould be Mr. Repton, I imagine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is what I was thinking of. As he has done so well by Smith, I\\r\\nthink I had better have him at once. His terms are five guineas a day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, and if they were _ten_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure _you_ need\\r\\nnot regard it. The expense need not be any impediment. If I were you,\\r\\nI should not think of the expense. I would have everything done in the\\r\\nbest style, and made as nice as possible. Such a place as Sotherton\\r\\nCourt deserves everything that taste and money can do. You have space to\\r\\nwork upon there, and grounds that will well reward you. For my own part,\\r\\nif I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton, I\\r\\nshould be always planting and improving, for naturally I am excessively\\r\\nfond of it. It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where\\r\\nI am now, with my little half acre. It would be quite a burlesque. But\\r\\nif I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight in improving and\\r\\nplanting. We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage: we made it\\r\\nquite a different place from what it was when we first had it. You young\\r\\nones do not remember much about it, perhaps; but if dear Sir Thomas were\\r\\nhere, he could tell you what improvements we made: and a great deal more\\r\\nwould have been done, but for poor Mr. Norris's sad state of health.\\r\\nHe could hardly ever get out, poor man, to enjoy anything, and _that_\\r\\ndisheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to\\r\\ntalk of. If it had not been for _that_, we should have carried on the\\r\\ngarden wall, and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard, just\\r\\nas Dr. Grant has done. We were always doing something as it was. It was\\r\\nonly the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris's death that we put in the\\r\\napricot against the stable wall, which is now grown such a noble tree,\\r\\nand getting to such perfection, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d addressing herself then to Dr.\\r\\nGrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Dr. Grant. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nsoil is good; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit\\r\\nshould be so little worth the trouble of gathering.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park, and it cost\\r\\nus--that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill--and I\\r\\nknow it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were imposed on, ma'am,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Dr. Grant: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthese potatoes have as\\r\\nmuch the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree. It\\r\\nis an insipid fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable, which\\r\\nnone from my garden are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe truth is, ma'am,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Grant, pretending to whisper across\\r\\nthe table to Mrs. Norris, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural\\r\\ntaste of our apricot is: he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it\\r\\nis so valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is such a\\r\\nremarkably large, fair sort, that what with early tarts and preserves,\\r\\nmy cook contrives to get them all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased; and, for a little\\r\\nwhile, other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton. Dr.\\r\\nGrant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had\\r\\nbegun in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmith's place\\r\\nis the admiration of all the country; and it was a mere nothing before\\r\\nRepton took it in hand. I think I shall have Repton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Rushworth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif I were you, I would have a\\r\\nvery pretty shrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine\\r\\nweather.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence, and\\r\\ntried to make out something complimentary; but, between his submission\\r\\nto _her_ taste, and his having always intended the same himself, with\\r\\nthe superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies\\r\\nin general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was\\r\\nanxious to please, he grew puzzled, and Edmund was glad to put an end\\r\\nto his speech by a proposal of wine. Mr. Rushworth, however, though not\\r\\nusually a great talker, had still more to say on the subject next his\\r\\nheart. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his\\r\\ngrounds, which is little enough, and makes it more surprising that the\\r\\nplace can have been so improved. Now, at Sotherton we have a good seven\\r\\nhundred, without reckoning the water meadows; so that I think, if so\\r\\nmuch could be done at Compton, we need not despair. There have been two\\r\\nor three fine old trees cut down, that grew too near the house, and\\r\\nit opens the prospect amazingly, which makes me think that Repton, or\\r\\nanybody of that sort, would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down:\\r\\nthe avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill,\\r\\nyou know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d turning to Miss Bertram particularly as he spoke. But Miss\\r\\nBertram thought it most becoming to reply--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe avenue! Oh! I do not recollect it. I really know very little of\\r\\nSotherton.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund, exactly opposite\\r\\nMiss Crawford, and who had been attentively listening, now looked at\\r\\nhim, and said in a low voice--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCut down an avenue! What a pity! Does it not make you think of Cowper?\\r\\n'Ye fallen avenues, once more I mourn your fate unmerited.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smiled as he answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance,\\r\\nFanny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down, to see the place\\r\\nas it is now, in its old state; but I do not suppose I shall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you never been there? No, you never can; and, unluckily, it is out\\r\\nof distance for a ride. I wish we could contrive it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! it does not signify. Whenever I do see it, you will tell me how it\\r\\nhas been altered.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI collect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Sotherton is an old place, and a\\r\\nplace of some grandeur. In any particular style of building?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe house was built in Elizabeth's time, and is a large, regular, brick\\r\\nbuilding; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good rooms. It\\r\\nis ill placed. It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park; in that\\r\\nrespect, unfavourable for improvement. But the woods are fine, and\\r\\nthere is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made a good deal of. Mr.\\r\\nRushworth is quite right, I think, in meaning to give it a modern dress,\\r\\nand I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford listened with submission, and said to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is a\\r\\nwell-bred man; he makes the best of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut, had I\\r\\na place to new fashion, I should not put myself into the hands of an\\r\\nimprover. I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own\\r\\nchoice, and acquired progressively. I would rather abide by my own\\r\\nblunders than by his.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ would know what you were about, of course; but that would not\\r\\nsuit _me_. I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters, but as they are\\r\\nbefore me; and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be most\\r\\nthankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it, and give me as much\\r\\nbeauty as he could for my money; and I should never look at it till it\\r\\nwas complete.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be delightful to _me_ to see the progress of it all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nFanny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, you have been brought up to it. It was no part of my education; and\\r\\nthe only dose I ever had, being administered by not the first favourite\\r\\nin the world, has made me consider improvements _in_ _hand_ as the\\r\\ngreatest of nuisances. Three years ago the Admiral, my honoured uncle,\\r\\nbought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in;\\r\\nand my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures; but it being\\r\\nexcessively pretty, it was soon found necessary to be improved, and for\\r\\nthree months we were all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk to\\r\\nstep on, or a bench fit for use. I would have everything as complete\\r\\nas possible in the country, shrubberies and flower-gardens, and rustic\\r\\nseats innumerable: but it must all be done without my care. Henry is\\r\\ndifferent; he loves to be doing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much disposed to\\r\\nadmire, speak so freely of her uncle. It did not suit his sense of\\r\\npropriety, and he was silenced, till induced by further smiles and\\r\\nliveliness to put the matter by for the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Bertram,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have tidings of my harp at last. I am\\r\\nassured that it is safe at Northampton; and there it has probably been\\r\\nthese ten days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often\\r\\nreceived to the contrary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe truth is, that our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant,\\r\\nwe went ourselves: this will not do seventy miles from London; but this\\r\\nmorning we heard of it in the right way. It was seen by some farmer, and\\r\\nhe told the miller, and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher's\\r\\nson-in-law left word at the shop.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means, and hope\\r\\nthere will be no further delay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it is to be conveyed?\\r\\nNot by a wagon or cart: oh no! nothing of that kind could be hired in\\r\\nthe village. I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou would find it difficult, I dare say, just now, in the middle of a\\r\\nvery late hay harvest, to hire a horse and cart?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it! To want\\r\\na horse and cart in the country seemed impossible, so I told my maid to\\r\\nspeak for one directly; and as I cannot look out of my dressing-closet\\r\\nwithout seeing one farmyard, nor walk in the shrubbery without passing\\r\\nanother, I thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather grieved\\r\\nthat I could not give the advantage to all. Guess my surprise, when\\r\\nI found that I had been asking the most unreasonable, most impossible\\r\\nthing in the world; had offended all the farmers, all the labourers,\\r\\nall the hay in the parish! As for Dr. Grant's bailiff, I believe I had\\r\\nbetter keep out of _his_ way; and my brother-in-law himself, who is all\\r\\nkindness in general, looked rather black upon me when he found what I\\r\\nhad been at.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou could not be expected to have thought on the subject before; but\\r\\nwhen you _do_ think of it, you must see the importance of getting in\\r\\nthe grass. The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you\\r\\nsuppose: our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but, in\\r\\nharvest, it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down with the\\r\\ntrue London maxim, that everything is to be got with money, I was a\\r\\nlittle embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country\\r\\ncustoms. However, I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry, who is\\r\\ngood-nature itself, has offered to fetch it in his barouche. Will it not\\r\\nbe honourably conveyed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument, and hoped to be\\r\\nsoon allowed to hear her. Fanny had never heard the harp at all, and\\r\\nwished for it very much.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be most happy to play to you both,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat\\r\\nleast as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for\\r\\nI dearly love music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the\\r\\nplayer must always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than\\r\\none. Now, Mr. Bertram, if you write to your brother, I entreat you to\\r\\ntell him that my harp is come: he heard so much of my misery about it.\\r\\nAnd you may say, if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive\\r\\nairs against his return, in compassion to his feelings, as I know his\\r\\nhorse will lose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not, at present,\\r\\nforesee any occasion for writing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you ever\\r\\nwrite to him, nor he to you, if it could be helped. The occasion would\\r\\nnever be foreseen. What strange creatures brothers are! You would not\\r\\nwrite to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world; and\\r\\nwhen obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill, or such\\r\\na relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words. You have but\\r\\none style among you. I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in every other\\r\\nrespect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me,\\r\\nconfides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never\\r\\nyet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more\\r\\nthan--'Dear Mary, I am just arrived. Bath seems full, and everything\\r\\nas usual. Yours sincerely.' That is the true manly style; that is a\\r\\ncomplete brother's letter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen they are at a distance from all their family,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny,\\r\\ncolouring for William's sake, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey can write long letters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Price has a brother at sea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhose excellence as a\\r\\ncorrespondent makes her think you too severe upon us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt sea, has she? In the king's service, of course?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story, but his determined\\r\\nsilence obliged her to relate her brother's situation: her voice was\\r\\nanimated in speaking of his profession, and the foreign stations he had\\r\\nbeen on; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been\\r\\nabsent without tears in her eyes. Miss Crawford civilly wished him an\\r\\nearly promotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you know anything of my cousin's captain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaptain\\r\\nMarshall? You have a large acquaintance in the navy, I conclude?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmong admirals, large enough; but,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with an air of grandeur, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe know\\r\\nvery little of the inferior ranks. Post-captains may be very good sort\\r\\nof men, but they do not belong to _us_. Of various admirals I could tell\\r\\nyou a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of their\\r\\npay, and their bickerings and jealousies. But, in general, I can assure\\r\\nyou that they are all passed over, and all very ill used. Certainly, my\\r\\nhome at my uncle's brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of\\r\\n_Rears_ and _Vices_ I saw enough. Now do not be suspecting me of a pun,\\r\\nI entreat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund again felt grave, and only replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a noble profession.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances: if it make\\r\\nthe fortune, and there be discretion in spending it; but, in short, it\\r\\nis not a favourite profession of mine. It has never worn an amiable form\\r\\nto _me_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy in the prospect of\\r\\nhearing her play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject of improving grounds, meanwhile, was still under\\r\\nconsideration among the others; and Mrs. Grant could not help addressing\\r\\nher brother, though it was calling his attention from Miss Julia\\r\\nBertram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Henry, have _you_ nothing to say? You have been an improver\\r\\nyourself, and from what I hear of Everingham, it may vie with any place\\r\\nin England. Its natural beauties, I am sure, are great. Everingham,\\r\\nas it _used_ to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall of\\r\\nground, and such timber! What would I not give to see it again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n was his answer; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I fear there would be some disappointment: you\\r\\nwould not find it equal to your present ideas. In extent, it is a mere\\r\\nnothing; you would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as for\\r\\nimprovement, there was very little for me to do--too little: I should\\r\\nlike to have been busy much longer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are fond of the sort of thing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Julia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcessively; but what with the natural advantages of the ground, which\\r\\npointed out, even to a very young eye, what little remained to be done,\\r\\nand my own consequent resolutions, I had not been of age three\\r\\nmonths before Everingham was all that it is now. My plan was laid\\r\\nat Westminster, a little altered, perhaps, at Cambridge, and at\\r\\none-and-twenty executed. I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having\\r\\nso much happiness yet before him. I have been a devourer of my own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Julia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ can never want employment. Instead of envying Mr.\\r\\nRushworth, you should assist him with your opinion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech, enforced it warmly,\\r\\npersuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother's; and as\\r\\nMiss Bertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,\\r\\ndeclaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better to consult\\r\\nwith friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw the\\r\\nbusiness into the hands of a professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very\\r\\nready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford's assistance; and Mr.\\r\\nCrawford, after properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at\\r\\nhis service in any way that could be useful. Mr. Rushworth then began to\\r\\npropose Mr. Crawford's doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton,\\r\\nand taking a bed there; when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in her two\\r\\nnieces' minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr.\\r\\nCrawford away, interposed with an amendment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford's willingness; but why should not\\r\\nmore of us go? Why should not we make a little party? Here are many that\\r\\nwould be interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth, and\\r\\nthat would like to hear Mr. Crawford's opinion on the spot, and that\\r\\nmight be of some small use to you with _their_ opinions; and, for my\\r\\nown part, I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again;\\r\\nnothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss; but\\r\\nnow I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth, while the rest\\r\\nof you walked about and settled things, and then we could all return\\r\\nto a late dinner here, or dine at Sotherton, just as might be most\\r\\nagreeable to your mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight.\\r\\nI dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche,\\r\\nand Edmund can go on horseback, you know, sister, and Fanny will stay at\\r\\nhome with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in the going\\r\\nwas forward in expressing their ready concurrence, excepting Edmund, who\\r\\nheard it all and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund the\\r\\nnext day, after thinking some time on the subject himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did you\\r\\nlike her yesterday?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well--very much. I like to hear her talk. She entertains me; and\\r\\nshe is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking at\\r\\nher.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is her countenance that is so attractive. She has a wonderful play\\r\\nof feature! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you,\\r\\nFanny, as not quite right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. I was\\r\\nquite astonished. An uncle with whom she has been living so many years,\\r\\nand who, whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother,\\r\\ntreating him, they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought you would be struck. It was very wrong; very indecorous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd very ungrateful, I think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUngrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her uncle has any claim\\r\\nto her _gratitude_; his wife certainly had; and it is the warmth of her\\r\\nrespect for her aunt's memory which misleads her here. She is awkwardly\\r\\ncircumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be\\r\\ndifficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford, without\\r\\nthrowing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which was most\\r\\nto blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral's present conduct\\r\\nmight incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural and amiable\\r\\nthat Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely. I do not censure her\\r\\n_opinions_; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in making them public.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not you think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, after a little consideration, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat this\\r\\nimpropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her niece has\\r\\nbeen entirely brought up by her? She cannot have given her right notions\\r\\nof what was due to the Admiral.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the faults of the niece\\r\\nto have been those of the aunt; and it makes one more sensible of the\\r\\ndisadvantages she has been under. But I think her present home must\\r\\ndo her good. Mrs. Grant's manners are just what they ought to be. She\\r\\nspeaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, except as to his writing her such short letters. She made me\\r\\nalmost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature\\r\\nof a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything\\r\\nworth reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure William\\r\\nwould never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances. And what right\\r\\nhad she to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters when you were\\r\\nabsent?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute\\r\\nto its own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when\\r\\nuntinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of\\r\\neither in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or\\r\\nloud, or coarse. She is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we\\r\\nhave been speaking of. There she cannot be justified. I am glad you saw\\r\\nit all as I did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chance\\r\\nof her thinking like him; though at this period, and on this subject,\\r\\nthere began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a line\\r\\nof admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny\\r\\ncould not follow. Miss Crawford's attractions did not lessen. The harp\\r\\narrived, and rather added to her beauty, wit, and good-humour; for she\\r\\nplayed with the greatest obligingness, with an expression and taste\\r\\nwhich were peculiarly becoming, and there was something clever to be\\r\\nsaid at the close of every air. Edmund was at the Parsonage every day,\\r\\nto be indulged with his favourite instrument: one morning secured an\\r\\ninvitation for the next; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a\\r\\nlistener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.\\r\\n\\r\\nA young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and\\r\\nboth placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a\\r\\nlittle lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was\\r\\nenough to catch any man's heart. The season, the scene, the air, were\\r\\nall favourable to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her tambour\\r\\nframe were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and as\\r\\neverything will turn to account when love is once set going, even the\\r\\nsandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth looking\\r\\nat. Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he was\\r\\nabout, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such intercourse,\\r\\nto be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady it may be added\\r\\nthat, without his being a man of the world or an elder brother, without\\r\\nany of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk, he began to\\r\\nbe agreeable to her. She felt it to be so, though she had not foreseen,\\r\\nand could hardly understand it; for he was not pleasant by any common\\r\\nrule: he talked no nonsense; he paid no compliments; his opinions\\r\\nwere unbending, his attentions tranquil and simple. There was a charm,\\r\\nperhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness, his integrity, which Miss\\r\\nCrawford might be equal to feel, though not equal to discuss with\\r\\nherself. She did not think very much about it, however: he pleased her\\r\\nfor the present; she liked to have him near her; it was enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning;\\r\\nshe would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited\\r\\nand unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when the\\r\\nevening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he should\\r\\nthink it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home, while\\r\\nMr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she thought it\\r\\na very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and\\r\\nwater for her, would rather go without it than not. She was a little\\r\\nsurprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford, and\\r\\nnot see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed, and of\\r\\nwhich _she_ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature\\r\\nwhenever she was in her company; but so it was. Edmund was fond of\\r\\nspeaking to her of Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it enough that\\r\\nthe Admiral had since been spared; and she scrupled to point out her own\\r\\nremarks to him, lest it should appear like ill-nature. The first actual\\r\\npain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an\\r\\ninclination to learn to ride, which the former caught, soon after her\\r\\nbeing settled at Mansfield, from the example of the young ladies at the\\r\\nPark, and which, when Edmund's acquaintance with her increased, led to\\r\\nhis encouraging the wish, and the offer of his own quiet mare for the\\r\\npurpose of her first attempts, as the best fitted for a beginner that\\r\\neither stable could furnish. No pain, no injury, however, was designed\\r\\nby him to his cousin in this offer: _she_ was not to lose a day's\\r\\nexercise by it. The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half\\r\\nan hour before her ride were to begin; and Fanny, on its being first\\r\\nproposed, so far from feeling slighted, was almost over-powered with\\r\\ngratitude that he should be asking her leave for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself, and no\\r\\ninconvenience to Fanny. Edmund, who had taken down the mare and presided\\r\\nat the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before either Fanny or\\r\\nthe steady old coachman, who always attended her when she rode without\\r\\nher cousins, were ready to set forward. The second day's trial was not\\r\\nso guiltless. Miss Crawford's enjoyment of riding was such that she did\\r\\nnot know how to leave off. Active and fearless, and though rather small,\\r\\nstrongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to the pure\\r\\ngenuine pleasure of the exercise, something was probably added in\\r\\nEdmund's attendance and instructions, and something more in the\\r\\nconviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early\\r\\nprogress, to make her unwilling to dismount. Fanny was ready and\\r\\nwaiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone,\\r\\nand still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared. To avoid her aunt,\\r\\nand look for him, she went out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of\\r\\neach other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she could\\r\\nlook down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its\\r\\ndemesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant's\\r\\nmeadow she immediately saw the group--Edmund and Miss Crawford both on\\r\\nhorse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,\\r\\nwith two or three grooms, standing about and looking on. A happy party\\r\\nit appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a\\r\\ndoubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a sound\\r\\nwhich did not make _her_ cheerful; she wondered that Edmund should\\r\\nforget her, and felt a pang. She could not turn her eyes from the\\r\\nmeadow; she could not help watching all that passed. At first Miss\\r\\nCrawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not\\r\\nsmall, at a foot's pace; then, at _her_ apparent suggestion, they rose\\r\\ninto a canter; and to Fanny's timid nature it was most astonishing to\\r\\nsee how well she sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmund\\r\\nwas close to her; he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing her\\r\\nmanagement of the bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or the\\r\\nimagination supplied what the eye could not reach. She must not wonder\\r\\nat all this; what could be more natural than that Edmund should be\\r\\nmaking himself useful, and proving his good-nature by any one? She could\\r\\nnot but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him\\r\\nthe trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and becoming\\r\\nin a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford, with all his\\r\\nboasted good-nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew nothing\\r\\nof the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund. She\\r\\nbegan to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty; if\\r\\nshe were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised\\r\\nby seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still on\\r\\nhorseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the\\r\\nlane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.\\r\\nShe began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked\\r\\nto meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Miss Price,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at all\\r\\nwithin hearing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am come to make my own apologies for keeping you\\r\\nwaiting; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself--I knew it\\r\\nwas very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if\\r\\nyou please, you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven,\\r\\nyou know, because there is no hope of a cure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his conviction that\\r\\nshe could be in no hurry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor there is more than time enough for my\\r\\ncousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand you have\\r\\nbeen promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an\\r\\nhour sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from the\\r\\nheat as she would have done then. I wish _you_ may not be fatigued by so\\r\\nmuch exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said she, as she sprang down with his help; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very strong. Nothing\\r\\never fatigues me but doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way to\\r\\nyou with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant\\r\\nride, and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear,\\r\\ndelightful, beautiful animal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, now\\r\\njoining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another\\r\\npart of the park; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing, as\\r\\nshe looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together to\\r\\nthe village; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on\\r\\nMiss Crawford's great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been\\r\\nwatching with an interest almost equal to her own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never see one sit a horse better. She did not seem to have\\r\\na thought of fear. Very different from you, miss, when you first began,\\r\\nsix years ago come next Easter. Lord bless you! how you did tremble when\\r\\nSir Thomas first had you put on!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated. Her merit in\\r\\nbeing gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated\\r\\nby the Miss Bertrams; her delight in riding was like their own; her\\r\\nearly excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasure\\r\\nin praising it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was sure she would ride well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Julia; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe has the make for it.\\r\\nHer figure is as neat as her brother's.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Maria, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand her spirits are as good, and she has the same\\r\\nenergy of character. I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a\\r\\ngreat deal to do with the mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride\\r\\nthe next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I do not know--not if you want the mare,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was her answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not want her at all for myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut whenever you are\\r\\nnext inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to\\r\\nhave her a longer time--for a whole morning, in short. She has a great\\r\\ndesire to get as far as Mansfield Common: Mrs. Grant has been telling\\r\\nher of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal\\r\\nto it. But any morning will do for this. She would be extremely sorry to\\r\\ninterfere with you. It would be very wrong if she did. _She_ rides only\\r\\nfor pleasure; _you_ for health.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall not ride to-morrow, certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been out\\r\\nvery often lately, and would rather stay at home. You know I am strong\\r\\nenough now to walk very well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny's comfort, and the ride to\\r\\nMansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all the\\r\\nyoung people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly\\r\\nenjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of this\\r\\nsort generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield\\r\\nCommon disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. There\\r\\nwere many other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot, there\\r\\nwere shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is always\\r\\nprovided with a shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were spent\\r\\nin this manner, in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing the\\r\\nhonours of its finest spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety and\\r\\ngood-humour, the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked\\r\\nof with pleasure--till the fourth day, when the happiness of one of\\r\\nthe party was exceedingly clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund and\\r\\nJulia were invited to dine at the Parsonage, and _she_ was excluded.\\r\\nIt was meant and done by Mrs. Grant, with perfect good-humour, on Mr.\\r\\nRushworth's account, who was partly expected at the Park that day;\\r\\nbut it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good manners were\\r\\nseverely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home.\\r\\nAs Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was increased, and she had\\r\\nnot even the relief of shewing her power over him; she could only be\\r\\nsullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and throw as great a gloom as\\r\\npossible over their dinner and dessert.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,\\r\\nfresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse\\r\\nof what they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would\\r\\nscarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was half-asleep;\\r\\nand even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece's ill-humour, and having\\r\\nasked one or two questions about the dinner, which were not immediately\\r\\nattended to, seemed almost determined to say no more. For a few minutes\\r\\nthe brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and\\r\\ntheir remarks on the stars, to think beyond themselves; but when the\\r\\nfirst pause came, Edmund, looking around, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut where is Fanny? Is\\r\\nshe gone to bed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, not that I know of,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Norris; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe was here a moment\\r\\nago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which was\\r\\na very long one, told them that she was on the sofa. Mrs. Norris began\\r\\nscolding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the evening\\r\\nupon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as\\r\\n_we_ do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the\\r\\npoor basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week,\\r\\nnot touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out. You\\r\\nshould learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it is a\\r\\nshocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore half this was said, Fanny was returned to her seat at the table,\\r\\nand had taken up her work again; and Julia, who was in high good-humour,\\r\\nfrom the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of exclaiming, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nmust say, ma'am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the\\r\\nhouse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, after looking at her attentively, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure you\\r\\nhave the headache.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can hardly believe you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know your looks too well. How\\r\\nlong have you had it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince a little before dinner. It is nothing but the heat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you go out in the heat?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo out! to be sure she did,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Norris: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould you have her stay\\r\\nwithin such a fine day as this? Were not we _all_ out? Even your mother\\r\\nwas out to-day for above an hour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, Edmund,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added her ladyship, who had been thoroughly\\r\\nawakened by Mrs. Norris's sharp reprimand to Fanny; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was out above an\\r\\nhour. I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny\\r\\ncut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It\\r\\nwas shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the coming\\r\\nhome again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny has been cutting roses, has she?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing! _She_\\r\\nfound it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could not\\r\\nwait.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was no help for it, certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rejoined Mrs. Norris, in a rather\\r\\nsoftened voice; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I question whether her headache might not be caught\\r\\n_then_, sister. There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and\\r\\nstooping in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well to-morrow. Suppose\\r\\nyou let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always forget to have mine\\r\\nfilled.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe has got it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe has had it ever since she came\\r\\nback from your house the second time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Edmund; \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas she been walking as well as cutting roses;\\r\\nwalking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma'am? No\\r\\nwonder her head aches.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was afraid it would be too much for her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\nwhen the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then\\r\\nyou know they must be taken home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and, unluckily,\\r\\nFanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key, so she\\r\\nwas obliged to go again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund got up and walked about the room, saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd could nobody be\\r\\nemployed on such an errand but Fanny? Upon my word, ma'am, it has been a\\r\\nvery ill-managed business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nMrs. Norris, unable to be longer deaf; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunless I had gone myself,\\r\\nindeed; but I cannot be in two places at once; and I was talking to Mr.\\r\\nGreen at that very time about your mother's dairymaid, by _her_ desire,\\r\\nand had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son,\\r\\nand the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour. I think nobody\\r\\ncan justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really I\\r\\ncannot do everything at once. And as for Fanny's just stepping down\\r\\nto my house for me--it is not much above a quarter of a mile--I cannot\\r\\nthink I was unreasonable to ask it. How often do I pace it three times a\\r\\nday, early and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about\\r\\nit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish Fanny had half your strength, ma'am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would not be\\r\\nknocked up so soon. She has not been out on horseback now this long\\r\\nwhile, and I am persuaded that, when she does not ride, she ought to\\r\\nwalk. If she had been riding before, I should not have asked it of her.\\r\\nBut I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the\\r\\nroses; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue\\r\\nof that kind; and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.\\r\\nBetween ourselves, Edmund,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nodding significantly at his mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was\\r\\ncutting the roses, and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that did the\\r\\nmischief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid it was, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the more candid Lady Bertram, who had\\r\\noverheard her; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very much afraid she caught the headache there,\\r\\nfor the heat was enough to kill anybody. It was as much as I could bear\\r\\nmyself. Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him from the\\r\\nflower-beds, was almost too much for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table,\\r\\non which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira to\\r\\nFanny, and obliged her to drink the greater part. She wished to be able\\r\\nto decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made\\r\\nit easier to swallow than to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nVexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt, he was still more angry\\r\\nwith himself. His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything which\\r\\nthey had done. Nothing of this would have happened had she been properly\\r\\nconsidered; but she had been left four days together without any choice\\r\\nof companions or exercise, and without any excuse for avoiding whatever\\r\\nher unreasonable aunts might require. He was ashamed to think that\\r\\nfor four days together she had not had the power of riding, and very\\r\\nseriously resolved, however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of\\r\\nMiss Crawford's, that it should never happen again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her\\r\\narrival at the Park. The state of her spirits had probably had its\\r\\nshare in her indisposition; for she had been feeling neglected, and been\\r\\nstruggling against discontent and envy for some days past. As she leant\\r\\non the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be seen, the\\r\\npain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head; and the sudden\\r\\nchange which Edmund's kindness had then occasioned, made her hardly know\\r\\nhow to support herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's rides recommenced the very next day; and as it was a pleasant\\r\\nfresh-feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been, Edmund\\r\\ntrusted that her losses, both of health and pleasure, would be soon made\\r\\ngood. While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his mother,\\r\\nwho came to be civil and to shew her civility especially, in urging the\\r\\nexecution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been started a\\r\\nfortnight before, and which, in consequence of her subsequent absence\\r\\nfrom home, had since lain dormant. Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all\\r\\nwell pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and agreed\\r\\nto, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies did\\r\\nnot forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly have\\r\\nanswered for his being so, they would neither authorise the liberty nor\\r\\nrun the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth\\r\\ndiscovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down\\r\\nto the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and inquire whether\\r\\nWednesday would suit him or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in. Having been out\\r\\nsome time, and taken a different route to the house, they had not met\\r\\nhim. Comfortable hopes, however, were given that he would find Mr.\\r\\nCrawford at home. The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. It was\\r\\nhardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of,\\r\\nfor Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, a\\r\\nwell-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of\\r\\nconsequence, but as it related to her own and her son's concerns,\\r\\nhad not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party. Lady\\r\\nBertram constantly declined it; but her placid manner of refusal made\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come, till Mrs. Norris's more\\r\\nnumerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, I\\r\\nassure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth. Ten miles there, and ten back, you\\r\\nknow. You must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our\\r\\ntwo dear girls and myself without her. Sotherton is the only place that\\r\\ncould give her a _wish_ to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. She will\\r\\nhave a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very well;\\r\\nand as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will answer\\r\\nfor his being most happy to join the party. He can go on horseback, you\\r\\nknow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram's staying at home,\\r\\ncould only be sorry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe loss of her ladyship's company would be a\\r\\ngreat drawback, and she should have been extremely happy to have seen\\r\\nthe young lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet, and\\r\\nit was a pity she should not see the place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs.\\r\\nNorris; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut as to Fanny, she will have opportunities in plenty of\\r\\nseeing Sotherton. She has time enough before her; and her going now is\\r\\nquite out of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no! I cannot do without Fanny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must\\r\\nbe wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the invitation;\\r\\nand though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs.\\r\\nRushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly declined it on\\r\\nher own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister;\\r\\nand Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in accepting\\r\\nher share of the civility. Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage\\r\\nsuccessful; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn\\r\\nwhat had been settled for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her\\r\\ncarriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two other ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris trying to\\r\\nmake up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford's being of the party were\\r\\ndesirable or not, or whether her brother's barouche would not be full\\r\\nwithout her. The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her that\\r\\nthe barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, on\\r\\nwhich _one_ might go with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why is it necessary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Crawford's carriage, or\\r\\nhis _only_, should be employed? Why is no use to be made of my mother's\\r\\nchaise? I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other\\r\\nday, understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the\\r\\ncarriage of the family.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Julia: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgo boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather,\\r\\nwhen we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that will not\\r\\nquite do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Maria, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us.\\r\\nAfter what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, my dear Edmund,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Mrs. Norris, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctaking out _two_ carriages\\r\\nwhen _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between\\r\\nourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and\\r\\nSotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching\\r\\nhis carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,\\r\\nwhen he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford's,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Maria; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and\\r\\ndoes not know how to drive. I will answer for it that we shall find no\\r\\ninconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin\\r\\ngoing on the barouche box.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnpleasant!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Maria: \\xe2\\x80\\x9coh dear! I believe it would be generally\\r\\nthought the favourite seat. There can be no comparison as to one's view\\r\\nof the country. Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box\\r\\nherself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere can be no objection, then, to Fanny's going with you; there can\\r\\nbe no doubt of your having room for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Mrs. Norris; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy dear Edmund, there is no idea of her\\r\\ngoing with us. She stays with her aunt. I told Mrs. Rushworth so. She is\\r\\nnot expected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can have no reason, I imagine, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, addressing his\\r\\nmother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor wishing Fanny _not_ to be of the party, but as it relates\\r\\nto yourself, to your own comfort. If you could do without her, you would\\r\\nnot wish to keep her at home?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure not, but I _cannot_ do without her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a general cry out at this. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is no\\r\\nnecessity for my going, and I mean to stay at home. Fanny has a great\\r\\ndesire to see Sotherton. I know she wishes it very much. She has not\\r\\noften a gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma'am, you would be\\r\\nglad to give her the pleasure now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could\\r\\nremain--their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could\\r\\nnot go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in\\r\\ntaking her, which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got\\r\\nover. It must have the strangest appearance! It would be something so\\r\\nvery unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth, whose\\r\\nown manners were such a pattern of good-breeding and attention, that she\\r\\nreally did not feel equal to it. Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny,\\r\\nand no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time; but her opposition to\\r\\nEdmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own scheme, because it\\r\\n_was_ her own, than from anything else. She felt that she had arranged\\r\\neverything extremely well, and that any alteration must be for the\\r\\nworse. When Edmund, therefore, told her in reply, as he did when she\\r\\nwould give him the hearing, that she need not distress herself on Mrs.\\r\\nRushworth's account, because he had taken the opportunity, as he walked\\r\\nwith her through the hall, of mentioning Miss Price as one who would\\r\\nprobably be of the party, and had directly received a very sufficient\\r\\ninvitation for his cousin, Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with\\r\\na very good grace, and would only say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, very well, just as\\r\\nyou chuse, settle it your own way, I am sure I do not care about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems very odd,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Maria, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you should be staying at home\\r\\ninstead of Fanny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Julia,\\r\\nhastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she\\r\\nought to offer to stay at home herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was\\r\\nEdmund's only reply, and the subject dropt.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's gratitude, when she heard the plan, was, in fact, much greater\\r\\nthan her pleasure. She felt Edmund's kindness with all, and more than\\r\\nall, the sensibility which he, unsuspicious of her fond attachment,\\r\\ncould be aware of; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her\\r\\naccount gave her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton\\r\\nwould be nothing without him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another\\r\\nalteration in the plan, and one that was admitted with general\\r\\napprobation. Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to Lady\\r\\nBertram in lieu of her son, and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner.\\r\\nLady Bertram was very well pleased to have it so, and the young ladies\\r\\nwere in spirits again. Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement\\r\\nwhich restored him to his share of the party; and Mrs. Norris thought it\\r\\nan excellent plan, and had it at her tongue's end, and was on the point\\r\\nof proposing it, when Mrs. Grant spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nWednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr.\\r\\nCrawford driving his sisters; and as everybody was ready, there was\\r\\nnothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take\\r\\ntheir places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post of\\r\\nhonour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall? While\\r\\neach of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most\\r\\nappearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settled\\r\\nby Mrs. Grant's saying, as she stepped from the carriage, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs there are\\r\\nfive of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry; and as\\r\\nyou were saying lately that you wished you could drive, Julia, I think\\r\\nthis will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy Julia! Unhappy Maria! The former was on the barouche-box in a\\r\\nmoment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification; and\\r\\nthe carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies,\\r\\nand the barking of Pug in his mistress's arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny, whose rides had\\r\\nnever been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happy\\r\\nin observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty. She was\\r\\nnot often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor did\\r\\nshe desire it. Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her\\r\\nbest companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the\\r\\nbearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the harvest,\\r\\nthe cottages, the cattle, the children, she found entertainment that\\r\\ncould only have been heightened by having Edmund to speak to of what she\\r\\nfelt. That was the only point of resemblance between her and the lady\\r\\nwho sat by her: in everything but a value for Edmund, Miss Crawford was\\r\\nvery unlike her. She had none of Fanny's delicacy of taste, of mind, of\\r\\nfeeling; she saw Nature, inanimate Nature, with little observation;\\r\\nher attention was all for men and women, her talents for the light\\r\\nand lively. In looking back after Edmund, however, when there was any\\r\\nstretch of road behind them, or when he gained on them in ascending a\\r\\nconsiderable hill, they were united, and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere he is\\xe2\\x80\\x9d broke at the\\r\\nsame moment from them both, more than once.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort:\\r\\nher prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by\\r\\nside, full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his expressive\\r\\nprofile as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the laugh of\\r\\nthe other, was a perpetual source of irritation, which her own sense\\r\\nof propriety could but just smooth over. When Julia looked back, it was\\r\\nwith a countenance of delight, and whenever she spoke to them, it was in\\r\\nthe highest spirits: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cher view of the country was charming, she wished\\r\\nthey could all see it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d etc.; but her only offer of exchange was\\r\\naddressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long hill,\\r\\nand was not more inviting than this: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere is a fine burst of country. I\\r\\nwish you had my seat, but I dare say you will not take it, let me press\\r\\nyou ever so much;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they\\r\\nwere moving again at a good pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came within the influence of Sotherton associations, it was\\r\\nbetter for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have two strings to her\\r\\nbow. She had Rushworth feelings, and Crawford feelings, and in\\r\\nthe vicinity of Sotherton the former had considerable effect. Mr.\\r\\nRushworth's consequence was hers. She could not tell Miss Crawford that\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthose woods belonged to Sotherton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she could not carelessly observe\\r\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth's property on each\\r\\nside of the road,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure\\r\\nto increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion,\\r\\nand ancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of\\r\\ncourt-leet and court-baron.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficulties\\r\\nare over. The rest of the way is such as it ought to be. Mr. Rushworth\\r\\nhas made it since he succeeded to the estate. Here begins the village.\\r\\nThose cottages are really a disgrace. The church spire is reckoned\\r\\nremarkably handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the great\\r\\nhouse as often happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must be\\r\\nterrible. There is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and I understand\\r\\nthe clergyman and his wife are very decent people. Those are almshouses,\\r\\nbuilt by some of the family. To the right is the steward's house; he\\r\\nis a very respectable man. Now we are coming to the lodge-gates; but we\\r\\nhave nearly a mile through the park still. It is not ugly, you see, at\\r\\nthis end; there is some fine timber, but the situation of the house is\\r\\ndreadful. We go down hill to it for half a mile, and it is a pity, for\\r\\nit would not be an ill-looking place if it had a better approach.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford was not slow to admire; she pretty well guessed Miss\\r\\nBertram's feelings, and made it a point of honour to promote her\\r\\nenjoyment to the utmost. Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility; and\\r\\neven Fanny had something to say in admiration, and might be heard with\\r\\ncomplacency. Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach;\\r\\nand after being at some pains to get a view of the house, and observing\\r\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was a sort of building which she could not look at but with\\r\\nrespect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, where is the avenue? The house fronts the\\r\\neast, I perceive. The avenue, therefore, must be at the back of it. Mr.\\r\\nRushworth talked of the west front.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, and\\r\\nascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. You may see\\r\\nsomething of it here--something of the more distant trees. It is oak\\r\\nentirely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had\\r\\nknown nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion; and her\\r\\nspirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish,\\r\\nwhen they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal\\r\\nentrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady; and the whole\\r\\nparty were welcomed by him with due attention. In the drawing-room they\\r\\nwere met with equal cordiality by the mother, and Miss Bertram had all\\r\\nthe distinction with each that she could wish. After the business of\\r\\narriving was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors were\\r\\nthrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the\\r\\nappointed dining-parlour, where a collation was prepared with abundance\\r\\nand elegance. Much was said, and much was ate, and all went well. The\\r\\nparticular object of the day was then considered. How would Mr. Crawford\\r\\nlike, in what manner would he chuse, to take a survey of the grounds?\\r\\nMr. Rushworth mentioned his curricle. Mr. Crawford suggested the greater\\r\\ndesirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be\\r\\ndepriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments,\\r\\nmight be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also; but this\\r\\nwas scarcely received as an amendment: the young ladies neither smiled\\r\\nnor spoke. Her next proposition, of shewing the house to such of them\\r\\nas had not been there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertram\\r\\nwas pleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doing\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth's guidance\\r\\nwere shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty, and many large, and\\r\\namply furnished in the taste of fifty years back, with shining floors,\\r\\nsolid mahogany, rich damask, marble, gilding, and carving, each handsome\\r\\nin its way. Of pictures there were abundance, and some few good, but\\r\\nthe larger part were family portraits, no longer anything to anybody\\r\\nbut Mrs. Rushworth, who had been at great pains to learn all that the\\r\\nhousekeeper could teach, and was now almost equally well qualified to\\r\\nshew the house. On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to\\r\\nMiss Crawford and Fanny, but there was no comparison in the willingness\\r\\nof their attention; for Miss Crawford, who had seen scores of great\\r\\nhouses, and cared for none of them, had only the appearance of civilly\\r\\nlistening, while Fanny, to whom everything was almost as interesting\\r\\nas it was new, attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs.\\r\\nRushworth could relate of the family in former times, its rise and\\r\\ngrandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts, delighted to connect anything\\r\\nwith history already known, or warm her imagination with scenes of the\\r\\npast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect\\r\\nfrom any of the rooms; and while Fanny and some of the others were\\r\\nattending Mrs. Rushworth, Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking\\r\\nhis head at the windows. Every room on the west front looked across\\r\\na lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron\\r\\npalisades and gates.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any\\r\\nother use than to contribute to the window-tax, and find employment for\\r\\nhousemaids, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Rushworth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe are coming to the chapel,\\r\\nwhich properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon; but\\r\\nas we are quite among friends, I will take you in this way, if you will\\r\\nexcuse me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey entered. Fanny's imagination had prepared her for something\\r\\ngrander than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of\\r\\ndevotion: with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion\\r\\nof mahogany, and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of\\r\\nthe family gallery above. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am disappointed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, in a low voice,\\r\\nto Edmund. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing awful\\r\\nhere, nothing melancholy, nothing grand. Here are no aisles, no arches,\\r\\nno inscriptions, no banners. No banners, cousin, to be 'blown by the\\r\\nnight wind of heaven.' No signs that a 'Scottish monarch sleeps below.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how\\r\\nconfined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and\\r\\nmonasteries. It was only for the private use of the family. They have\\r\\nbeen buried, I suppose, in the parish church. _There_ you must look for\\r\\nthe banners and the achievements.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth began her relation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis chapel was fitted up as you see\\r\\nit, in James the Second's time. Before that period, as I understand,\\r\\nthe pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think that\\r\\nthe linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple\\r\\ncloth; but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome chapel, and was\\r\\nformerly in constant use both morning and evening. Prayers were always\\r\\nread in it by the domestic chaplain, within the memory of many; but the\\r\\nlate Mr. Rushworth left it off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery generation has its improvements,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, with a\\r\\nsmile, to Edmund.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford; and\\r\\nEdmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a pity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat the custom should have been\\r\\ndiscontinued. It was a valuable part of former times. There is something\\r\\nin a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house,\\r\\nwith one's ideas of what such a household should be! A whole family\\r\\nassembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery fine indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, laughing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must do the heads\\r\\nof the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and\\r\\nfootmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here twice\\r\\na day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_That_ is hardly Fanny's idea of a family assembling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf\\r\\nthe master and mistress do _not_ attend themselves, there must be more\\r\\nharm than good in the custom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such\\r\\nsubjects. Everybody likes to go their own way--to chuse their own time\\r\\nand manner of devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality, the\\r\\nrestraint, the length of time--altogether it is a formidable thing, and\\r\\nwhat nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in\\r\\nthat gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men\\r\\nand women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke with a\\r\\nheadache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed,\\r\\nthey would have jumped with joy and envy. Cannot you imagine with what\\r\\nunwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did\\r\\nmany a time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs.\\r\\nBridgets--starched up into seeming piety, but with heads full of\\r\\nsomething very different--especially if the poor chaplain were not worth\\r\\nlooking at--and, in those days, I fancy parsons were very inferior even\\r\\nto what they are now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a few moments she was unanswered. Fanny coloured and looked\\r\\nat Edmund, but felt too angry for speech; and he needed a little\\r\\nrecollection before he could say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour lively mind can hardly be\\r\\nserious even on serious subjects. You have given us an amusing sketch,\\r\\nand human nature cannot say it was not so. We must all feel _at_ _times_\\r\\nthe difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish; but if you are\\r\\nsupposing it a frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown into a\\r\\nhabit from neglect, what could be expected from the _private_ devotions\\r\\nof such persons? Do you think the minds which are suffered, which\\r\\nare indulged in wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected in a\\r\\ncloset?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very likely. They would have two chances at least in their favour.\\r\\nThere would be less to distract the attention from without, and it would\\r\\nnot be tried so long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe mind which does not struggle against itself under _one_\\r\\ncircumstance, would find objects to distract it in the _other_, I\\r\\nbelieve; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse\\r\\nbetter feelings than are begun with. The greater length of the service,\\r\\nhowever, I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. One\\r\\nwishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to\\r\\nforget what chapel prayers are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the\\r\\nchapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford's attention to her sister, by saying,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as\\r\\nif the ceremony were going to be performed. Have not they completely the\\r\\nair of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward to Maria,\\r\\nsaid, in a voice which she only could hear, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not like to see Miss\\r\\nBertram so near the altar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two, but recovering\\r\\nherself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him, in a tone not\\r\\nmuch louder, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he would give her away?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid I should do it very awkwardly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his reply, with a look\\r\\nof meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place\\r\\ndirectly, if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether,\\r\\nand nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And she\\r\\ntalked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the\\r\\ncomprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother, and expose her sister to\\r\\nthe whispered gallantries of her lover, while Mrs. Rushworth spoke\\r\\nwith proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her\\r\\nwhenever it took place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Edmund were but in orders!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Julia, and running to where he\\r\\nstood with Miss Crawford and Fanny: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Edmund, if you were but in\\r\\norders now, you might perform the ceremony directly. How unlucky that\\r\\nyou are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford's countenance, as Julia spoke, might have amused a\\r\\ndisinterested observer. She looked almost aghast under the new idea she\\r\\nwas receiving. Fanny pitied her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow distressed she will be at what she\\r\\nsaid just now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d passed across her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrdained!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat, are you to be a clergyman?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; I shall take orders soon after my father's return--probably at\\r\\nChristmas.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering her complexion,\\r\\nreplied only, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I had known this before, I would have spoken of the\\r\\ncloth with more respect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and turned the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness\\r\\nwhich reigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year. Miss\\r\\nBertram, displeased with her sister, led the way, and all seemed to feel\\r\\nthat they had been there long enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn, and Mrs.\\r\\nRushworth, never weary in the cause, would have proceeded towards the\\r\\nprincipal staircase, and taken them through all the rooms above, if her\\r\\nson had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor\\r\\nif,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, with the sort of self-evident proposition which many a\\r\\nclearer head does not always avoid, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe are _too_ long going over the\\r\\nhouse, we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors. It is\\r\\npast two, and we are to dine at five.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying the grounds,\\r\\nwith the who and the how, was likely to be more fully agitated, and Mrs.\\r\\nNorris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses\\r\\nmost could be done, when the young people, meeting with an outward door,\\r\\ntemptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and\\r\\nshrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds, as by one impulse, one\\r\\nwish for air and liberty, all walked out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuppose we turn down here for the present,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Rushworth,\\r\\ncivilly taking the hint and following them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere are the greatest\\r\\nnumber of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuery,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Crawford, looking round him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether we may not find\\r\\nsomething to employ us here before we go farther? I see walls of great\\r\\npromise. Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJames,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Rushworth to her son, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe the wilderness\\r\\nwill be new to all the party. The Miss Bertrams have never seen the\\r\\nwilderness yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNo objection was made, but for some time there seemed no inclination to\\r\\nmove in any plan, or to any distance. All were attracted at first by the\\r\\nplants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy independence.\\r\\nMr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilities\\r\\nof that end of the house. The lawn, bounded on each side by a high wall,\\r\\ncontained beyond the first planted area a bowling-green, and beyond\\r\\nthe bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed by iron palisades, and\\r\\ncommanding a view over them into the tops of the trees of the wilderness\\r\\nimmediately adjoining. It was a good spot for fault-finding. Mr.\\r\\nCrawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth; and when,\\r\\nafter a little time, the others began to form into parties, these three\\r\\nwere found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund, Miss Crawford,\\r\\nand Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and who, after a short\\r\\nparticipation of their regrets and difficulties, left them and walked\\r\\non. The remaining three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, were\\r\\nstill far behind; for Julia, whose happy star no longer prevailed,\\r\\nwas obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth, and restrain her\\r\\nimpatient feet to that lady's slow pace, while her aunt, having fallen\\r\\nin with the housekeeper, who was come out to feed the pheasants, was\\r\\nlingering behind in gossip with her. Poor Julia, the only one out of\\r\\nthe nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot, was now in a state of\\r\\ncomplete penance, and as different from the Julia of the barouche-box as\\r\\ncould well be imagined. The politeness which she had been brought up to\\r\\npractise as a duty made it impossible for her to escape; while the\\r\\nwant of that higher species of self-command, that just consideration of\\r\\nothers, that knowledge of her own heart, that principle of right, which\\r\\nhad not formed any essential part of her education, made her miserable\\r\\nunder it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is insufferably hot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, when they had taken one\\r\\nturn on the terrace, and were drawing a second time to the door in the\\r\\nmiddle which opened to the wilderness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall any of us object to being\\r\\ncomfortable? Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it.\\r\\nWhat happiness if the door should not be locked! but of course it is;\\r\\nfor in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go\\r\\nwhere they like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were all agreed in\\r\\nturning joyfully through it, and leaving the unmitigated glare of day\\r\\nbehind. A considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness,\\r\\nwhich was a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly of\\r\\nlarch and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid out with too much\\r\\nregularity, was darkness and shade, and natural beauty, compared with\\r\\nthe bowling-green and the terrace. They all felt the refreshment of it,\\r\\nand for some time could only walk and admire. At length, after a short\\r\\npause, Miss Crawford began with, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you are to be a clergyman, Mr.\\r\\nBertram. This is rather a surprise to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy should it surprise you? You must suppose me designed for some\\r\\nprofession, and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer, nor a\\r\\nsoldier, nor a sailor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me. And you know there\\r\\nis generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second\\r\\nson.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA very praiseworthy practice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut not quite universal.\\r\\nI am one of the exceptions, and _being_ one, must do something for\\r\\nmyself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why are you to be a clergyman? I thought _that_ was always the lot\\r\\nof the youngest, where there were many to chuse before him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think the church itself never chosen, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Never_ is a black word. But yes, in the _never_ of conversation, which\\r\\nmeans _not_ _very_ _often_, I do think it. For what is to be done in the\\r\\nchurch? Men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the other\\r\\nlines distinction may be gained, but not in the church. A clergyman is\\r\\nnothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe _nothing_ of conversation has its gradations, I hope, as well as\\r\\nthe _never_. A clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion. He must\\r\\nnot head mobs, or set the ton in dress. But I cannot call that situation\\r\\nnothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance\\r\\nto mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally and\\r\\neternally, which has the guardianship of religion and morals, and\\r\\nconsequently of the manners which result from their influence. No one\\r\\nhere can call the _office_ nothing. If the man who holds it is so, it\\r\\nis by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just importance, and\\r\\nstepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been\\r\\nused to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend. One does not see\\r\\nmuch of this influence and importance in society, and how can it be\\r\\nacquired where they are so seldom seen themselves? How can two sermons a\\r\\nweek, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have\\r\\nthe sense to prefer Blair's to his own, do all that you speak of? govern\\r\\nthe conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest\\r\\nof the week? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ are speaking of London, _I_ am speaking of the nation at large.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the\\r\\nkingdom. We do not look in great cities for our best morality. It is not\\r\\nthere that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; and\\r\\nit certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most\\r\\nfelt. A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in fine\\r\\npreaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and\\r\\nhis neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size\\r\\ncapable of knowing his private character, and observing his general\\r\\nconduct, which in London can rarely be the case. The clergy are lost\\r\\nthere in the crowds of their parishioners. They are known to the largest\\r\\npart only as preachers. And with regard to their influencing public\\r\\nmanners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean to\\r\\ncall them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of refinement\\r\\nand courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life. The _manners_ I\\r\\nspeak of might rather be called _conduct_, perhaps, the result of good\\r\\nprinciples; the effect, in short, of those doctrines which it is their\\r\\nduty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe, be everywhere\\r\\nfound, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought to be, so are\\r\\nthe rest of the nation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, with gentle earnestness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou have quite convinced Miss Price\\r\\nalready.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish I could convince Miss Crawford too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think you ever will,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, with an arch smile; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am just\\r\\nas much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take\\r\\norders. You really are fit for something better. Come, do change your\\r\\nmind. It is not too late. Go into the law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo into the law! With as much ease as I was told to go into this\\r\\nwilderness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness\\r\\nof the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have forestalled you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a\\r\\n_bon_ _mot_, for there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a very\\r\\nmatter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a\\r\\nrepartee for half an hour together without striking it out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA general silence succeeded. Each was thoughtful. Fanny made the first\\r\\ninterruption by saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder that I should be tired with only\\r\\nwalking in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it\\r\\nis not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little\\r\\nwhile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm within his,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chow thoughtless I have been! I hope you are not very tired. Perhaps,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n turning to Miss Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy other companion may do me the honour of\\r\\ntaking an arm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, but I am not at all tired.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She took it, however, as she\\r\\nspoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a\\r\\nconnexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of Fanny.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou scarcely touch me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou do not make me of any use. What a\\r\\ndifference in the weight of a woman's arm from that of a man! At Oxford\\r\\nI have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of\\r\\na street, and you are only a fly in the comparison.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am really not tired, which I almost wonder at; for we must have\\r\\nwalked at least a mile in this wood. Do not you think we have?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot half a mile,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much in\\r\\nlove as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! you do not consider how much we have wound about. We have taken\\r\\nsuch a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a mile\\r\\nlong in a straight line, for we have never seen the end of it yet since\\r\\nwe left the first great path.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if you remember, before we left that first great path, we saw\\r\\ndirectly to the end of it. We looked down the whole vista, and saw it\\r\\nclosed by iron gates, and it could not have been more than a furlong in\\r\\nlength.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure it is a very long\\r\\nwood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into\\r\\nit; and therefore, when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must\\r\\nspeak within compass.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have been exactly a quarter of an hour here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, taking\\r\\nout his watch. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think we are walking four miles an hour?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! do not attack me with your watch. A watch is always too fast or too\\r\\nslow. I cannot be dictated to by a watch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk they\\r\\nhad been talking of; and standing back, well shaded and sheltered, and\\r\\nlooking over a ha-ha into the park, was a comfortable-sized bench, on\\r\\nwhich they all sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid you are very tired, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, observing her;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy would not you speak sooner? This will be a bad day's amusement for\\r\\nyou if you are to be knocked up. Every sort of exercise fatigues her so\\r\\nsoon, Miss Crawford, except riding.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all\\r\\nlast week! I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen\\r\\nagain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Your_ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own\\r\\nneglect. Fanny's interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for there\\r\\nis nothing in the course of one's duties so fatiguing as what we have\\r\\nbeen doing this morning: seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to\\r\\nanother, straining one's eyes and one's attention, hearing what one does\\r\\nnot understand, admiring what one does not care for. It is generally\\r\\nallowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price has found\\r\\nit so, though she did not know it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall soon be rested,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto sit in the shade on a fine\\r\\nday, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must move,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresting fatigues me. I have looked across the ha-ha till I\\r\\nam weary. I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view,\\r\\nwithout being able to see it so well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund left the seat likewise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Miss Crawford, if you will look up\\r\\nthe walk, you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long,\\r\\nor half half a mile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is an immense distance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see _that_ with a glance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe still reasoned with her, but in vain. She would not calculate, she\\r\\nwould not compare. She would only smile and assert. The greatest degree\\r\\nof rational consistency could not have been more engaging, and they\\r\\ntalked with mutual satisfaction. At last it was agreed that they should\\r\\nendeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little\\r\\nmore about it. They would go to one end of it, in the line they were\\r\\nthen in--for there was a straight green walk along the bottom by\\r\\nthe side of the ha-ha--and perhaps turn a little way in some other\\r\\ndirection, if it seemed likely to assist them, and be back in a few\\r\\nminutes. Fanny said she was rested, and would have moved too, but this\\r\\nwas not suffered. Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an\\r\\nearnestness which she could not resist, and she was left on the bench to\\r\\nthink with pleasure of her cousin's care, but with great regret that she\\r\\nwas not stronger. She watched them till they had turned the corner, and\\r\\nlistened till all sound of them had ceased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\nA quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still\\r\\nthinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption\\r\\nfrom any one. She began to be surprised at being left so long, and to\\r\\nlisten with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices\\r\\nagain. She listened, and at length she heard; she heard voices and feet\\r\\napproaching; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those\\r\\nshe wanted, when Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued\\r\\nfrom the same path which she had trod herself, and were before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Price all alone\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Fanny, how comes this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were the\\r\\nfirst salutations. She told her story. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor dear Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her\\r\\ncousin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow ill you have been used by them! You had better have staid\\r\\nwith us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen seating herself with a gentleman on each side, she resumed\\r\\nthe conversation which had engaged them before, and discussed the\\r\\npossibility of improvements with much animation. Nothing was fixed\\r\\non; but Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generally\\r\\nspeaking, whatever he proposed was immediately approved, first by her,\\r\\nand then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be to\\r\\nhear the others, and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own\\r\\nbeyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith's place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram, observing the iron\\r\\ngate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park, that their\\r\\nviews and their plans might be more comprehensive. It was the very thing\\r\\nof all others to be wished, it was the best, it was the only way of\\r\\nproceeding with any advantage, in Henry Crawford's opinion; and he\\r\\ndirectly saw a knoll not half a mile off, which would give them exactly\\r\\nthe requisite command of the house. Go therefore they must to that\\r\\nknoll, and through that gate; but the gate was locked. Mr. Rushworth\\r\\nwished he had brought the key; he had been very near thinking whether he\\r\\nshould not bring the key; he was determined he would never come without\\r\\nthe key again; but still this did not remove the present evil. They\\r\\ncould not get through; and as Miss Bertram's inclination for so doing\\r\\ndid by no means lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth's declaring outright\\r\\nthat he would go and fetch the key. He set off accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far from\\r\\nthe house already,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Crawford, when he was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, there is nothing else to be done. But now, sincerely, do not you\\r\\nfind the place altogether worse than you expected?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander, more complete in\\r\\nits style, though that style may not be the best. And to tell you the\\r\\ntruth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d speaking rather lower, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think that _I_ shall ever see\\r\\nSotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer will\\r\\nhardly improve it to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a moment's embarrassment the lady replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are too much a\\r\\nman of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. If other people\\r\\nthink Sotherton improved, I have no doubt that you will.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be\\r\\ngood for me in some points. My feelings are not quite so evanescent, nor\\r\\nmy memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the\\r\\ncase with men of the world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was followed by a short silence. Miss Bertram began again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nseemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. I was glad to\\r\\nsee you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWere we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollection\\r\\nat what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of\\r\\nan old Irish groom of my uncle's. Your sister loves to laugh.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou think her more light-hearted than I am?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMore easily amused,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsequently, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d smiling,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbetter company. I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish\\r\\nanecdotes during a ten miles' drive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNaturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I have more to think\\r\\nof now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very high\\r\\nspirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are too\\r\\nfair to justify want of spirits. You have a very smiling scene before\\r\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you mean literally or figuratively? Literally, I conclude. Yes,\\r\\ncertainly, the sun shines, and the park looks very cheerful. But\\r\\nunluckily that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint and\\r\\nhardship. 'I cannot get out,' as the starling said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As she spoke, and\\r\\nit was with expression, she walked to the gate: he followed her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr.\\r\\nRushworth is so long fetching this key!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr.\\r\\nRushworth's authority and protection, or I think you might with little\\r\\ndifficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance;\\r\\nI think it might be done, if you really wished to be more at large, and\\r\\ncould allow yourself to think it not prohibited.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cProhibited! nonsense! I certainly can get out that way, and I will.\\r\\nMr. Rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out of\\r\\nsight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will\\r\\nfind us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help making an effort to\\r\\nprevent it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will hurt yourself, Miss Bertram,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou will\\r\\ncertainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown;\\r\\nyou will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had better not\\r\\ngo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken,\\r\\nand, smiling with all the good-humour of success, she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you,\\r\\nmy dear Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase of pleasant\\r\\nfeelings, for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard,\\r\\nastonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford. By taking\\r\\na circuitous route, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonable\\r\\ndirection to the knoll, they were soon beyond her eye; and for some\\r\\nminutes longer she remained without sight or sound of any companion.\\r\\nShe seemed to have the little wood all to herself. She could almost\\r\\nhave thought that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it, but that it was\\r\\nimpossible for Edmund to forget her so entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:\\r\\nsomebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk. She\\r\\nexpected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath,\\r\\nand with a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeyday!\\r\\nWhere are the others? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny explained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA pretty trick, upon my word! I cannot see them anywhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d looking\\r\\neagerly into the park. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut they cannot be very far off, and I think I\\r\\nam equal to as much as Maria, even without help.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key. Do\\r\\nwait for Mr. Rushworth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot I, indeed. I have had enough of the family for one morning. Why,\\r\\nchild, I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother. Such a\\r\\npenance as I have been enduring, while you were sitting here so composed\\r\\nand so happy! It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in my\\r\\nplace, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and let\\r\\nit pass: Julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty; but she felt that it\\r\\nwould not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her if she\\r\\nhad not seen Mr. Rushworth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, we saw him. He was posting away as if upon life and death,\\r\\nand could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you all\\r\\nwere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_That_ is Miss Maria's concern. I am not obliged to punish myself for\\r\\n_her_ sins. The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt\\r\\nwas dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get away\\r\\nfrom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not\\r\\nattending to Fanny's last question of whether she had seen anything of\\r\\nMiss Crawford and Edmund. The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of\\r\\nseeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued\\r\\nabsence, however, as she might have done. She felt that he had been\\r\\nvery ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had\\r\\npassed. He joined her within five minutes after Julia's exit; and\\r\\nthough she made the best of the story, he was evidently mortified and\\r\\ndispleased in no common degree. At first he scarcely said anything; his\\r\\nlooks only expressed his extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked to\\r\\nthe gate and stood there, without seeming to know what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey desired me to stay--my cousin Maria charged me to say that you\\r\\nwould find them at that knoll, or thereabouts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not believe I shall go any farther,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he sullenly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see\\r\\nnothing of them. By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone\\r\\nsomewhere else. I have had walking enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is very unlucky.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And she longed to be\\r\\nable to say something more to the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an interval of silence, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think they might as well have staid for\\r\\nme,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Bertram thought you would follow her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should not have had to follow her if she had staid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced. After another pause,\\r\\nhe went on--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray, Miss Price, are you such a great admirer of this Mr.\\r\\nCrawford as some people are? For my part, I can see nothing in him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think him at all handsome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHandsome! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome. He is not\\r\\nfive foot nine. I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot\\r\\neight. I think he is an ill-looking fellow. In my opinion, these\\r\\nCrawfords are no addition at all. We did very well without them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she did not know how to contradict\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have\\r\\nbeen some excuse, but I went the very moment she said she wanted it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure, and I dare\\r\\nsay you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, you\\r\\nknow, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when people\\r\\nare waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute seems\\r\\nlike five.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got up and walked to the gate again, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwished he had had the key\\r\\nabout him at the time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fanny thought she discerned in his standing\\r\\nthere an indication of relenting, which encouraged her to another\\r\\nattempt, and she said, therefore, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a pity you should not join\\r\\nthem. They expected to have a better view of the house from that part\\r\\nof the park, and will be thinking how it may be improved; and nothing of\\r\\nthat sort, you know, can be settled without you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a\\r\\ncompanion. Mr. Rushworth was worked on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you\\r\\nreally think I had better go: it would be foolish to bring the key\\r\\nfor nothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And letting himself out, he walked off without farther\\r\\nceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so\\r\\nlong ago, and getting quite impatient, she resolved to go in search\\r\\nof them. She followed their steps along the bottom walk, and had just\\r\\nturned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford\\r\\nonce more caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings\\r\\nbrought them before her. They were just returned into the wilderness\\r\\nfrom the park, to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very\\r\\nsoon after their leaving her, and they had been across a portion of the\\r\\npark into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning\\r\\nto reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees. This\\r\\nwas their history. It was evident that they had been spending their time\\r\\npleasantly, and were not aware of the length of their absence. Fanny's\\r\\nbest consolation was in being assured that Edmund had wished for her\\r\\nvery much, and that he should certainly have come back for her, had she\\r\\nnot been tired already; but this was not quite sufficient to do away\\r\\nwith the pain of having been left a whole hour, when he had talked of\\r\\nonly a few minutes, nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know\\r\\nwhat they had been conversing about all that time; and the result of\\r\\nthe whole was to her disappointment and depression, as they prepared by\\r\\ngeneral agreement to return to the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Mrs. Rushworth\\r\\nand Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the\\r\\nwilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the\\r\\nhouse. Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatever\\r\\ncross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces,\\r\\nshe had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper,\\r\\nafter a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken her\\r\\nto the dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the receipt\\r\\nfor a famous cream cheese; and since Julia's leaving them they had\\r\\nbeen met by the gardener, with whom she had made a most satisfactory\\r\\nacquaintance, for she had set him right as to his grandson's illness,\\r\\nconvinced him that it was an ague, and promised him a charm for it; and\\r\\nhe, in return, had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants, and\\r\\nactually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this _rencontre_ they all returned to the house together, there\\r\\nto lounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, and\\r\\nQuarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of\\r\\ndinner. It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came\\r\\nin, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially\\r\\nagreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the\\r\\nobject of the day. By their own accounts they had been all walking after\\r\\neach other, and the junction which had taken place at last seemed, to\\r\\nFanny's observation, to have been as much too late for re-establishing\\r\\nharmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration.\\r\\nShe felt, as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth, that hers was not\\r\\nthe only dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was gloom on the face of\\r\\neach. Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay, and she thought\\r\\nthat he was taking particular pains, during dinner, to do away any\\r\\nlittle resentment of the other two, and restore general good-humour.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles' drive home\\r\\nallowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to\\r\\ntable, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came\\r\\nto the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained a\\r\\nfew pheasants' eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made\\r\\nabundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead the\\r\\nway. At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope I\\r\\nam not to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air\\r\\nin so exposed a seat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The request had not been foreseen, but was very\\r\\ngraciously received, and Julia's day was likely to end almost as well as\\r\\nit began. Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different, and\\r\\nwas a little disappointed; but her conviction of being really the\\r\\none preferred comforted her under it, and enabled her to receive Mr.\\r\\nRushworth's parting attentions as she ought. He was certainly better\\r\\npleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending\\r\\nthe box, and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nMrs. Norris, as they drove through the park. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing but pleasure from\\r\\nbeginning to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your\\r\\naunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go. A pretty good day's\\r\\namusement you have had!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria was just discontented enough to say directly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think _you_ have\\r\\ndone pretty well yourself, ma'am. Your lap seems full of good things,\\r\\nand here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my\\r\\nelbow unmercifully.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old\\r\\ngardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it in\\r\\nmy lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me; take\\r\\ngreat care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just like\\r\\nthe excellent one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that good old\\r\\nMrs. Whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses. I stood out as long\\r\\nas I could, till the tears almost came into her eyes, and I knew it was\\r\\njust the sort that my sister would be delighted with. That Mrs. Whitaker\\r\\nis a treasure! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was\\r\\nallowed at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids for\\r\\nwearing white gowns. Take care of the cheese, Fanny. Now I can manage\\r\\nthe other parcel and the basket very well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat else have you been spunging?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Maria, half-pleased that\\r\\nSotherton should be so complimented.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpunging, my dear! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants'\\r\\neggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me: she would not take\\r\\na denial. She said it must be such an amusement to me, as she understood\\r\\nI lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures of that sort; and\\r\\nso to be sure it will. I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the\\r\\nfirst spare hen, and if they come to good I can have them moved to my\\r\\nown house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great delight to me in\\r\\nmy lonely hours to attend to them. And if I have good luck, your mother\\r\\nshall have some.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the drive was as\\r\\npleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it; but when Mrs. Norris\\r\\nceased speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within. Their\\r\\nspirits were in general exhausted; and to determine whether the day had\\r\\nafforded most pleasure or pain, might occupy the meditations of almost\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections, afforded the Miss\\r\\nBertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the letters\\r\\nfrom Antigua, which soon afterwards reached Mansfield. It was much\\r\\npleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father; and to think\\r\\nof their father in England again within a certain period, which these\\r\\nletters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember was the black month fixed for his return. Sir Thomas wrote of\\r\\nit with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise. His\\r\\nbusiness was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take\\r\\nhis passage in the September packet, and he consequently looked forward\\r\\nwith the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the father brought a\\r\\nhusband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness\\r\\nwould unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happiness\\r\\nshould depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to\\r\\nthrow a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she should\\r\\nsee something else. It would hardly be _early_ in November, there\\r\\nwere generally delays, a bad passage or _something_; that favouring\\r\\n_something_ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or\\r\\ntheir understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. It would\\r\\nprobably be the middle of November at least; the middle of November\\r\\nwas three months off. Three months comprised thirteen weeks. Much might\\r\\nhappen in thirteen weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that\\r\\nhis daughters felt on the subject of his return, and would hardly have\\r\\nfound consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the\\r\\nbreast of another young lady. Miss Crawford, on walking up with her\\r\\nbrother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news; and\\r\\nthough seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness, and\\r\\nto have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it with\\r\\nan attention not so easily satisfied. Mrs. Norris gave the particulars\\r\\nof the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea, as Miss\\r\\nCrawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking\\r\\nout on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr. Rushworth,\\r\\nand Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte, she\\r\\nsuddenly revived it by turning round towards the group, and saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow\\r\\nhappy Mr. Rushworth looks! He is thinking of November.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour father's return will be a very interesting event.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but\\r\\nincluding so many dangers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your\\r\\nsister's marriage, and your taking orders.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon't be affronted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, laughing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it does put me in mind of\\r\\nsome of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in\\r\\na foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no sacrifice in the case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Edmund, with a serious\\r\\nsmile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is entirely her own\\r\\ndoing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She has done no more than\\r\\nwhat every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her being\\r\\nextremely happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria's\\r\\nmarrying.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is fortunate that your inclination and your father's convenience\\r\\nshould accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I\\r\\nunderstand, hereabouts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich you suppose has biassed me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut _that_ I am sure it has not,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would affirm\\r\\nmyself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for\\r\\nme probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should. There\\r\\nwas no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no reason why\\r\\na man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a\\r\\ncompetence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I should not have\\r\\nbeen influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father was too\\r\\nconscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I was biased, but\\r\\nI think it was blamelessly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is the same sort of thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, after a short pause, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas for\\r\\nthe son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be\\r\\nin the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody wonders that\\r\\nthey should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best, or\\r\\nsuspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either\\r\\nnavy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its favour:\\r\\nheroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are always\\r\\nacceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and\\r\\nsailors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of\\r\\npreferment may be fairly suspected, you think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be\\r\\njustified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty\\r\\nof any provision.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed;\\r\\nabsolute madness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither to\\r\\ntake orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would not\\r\\nknow what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from\\r\\nyour own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those feelings which\\r\\nyou rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in\\r\\ntheir choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are\\r\\nall against him, he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting\\r\\nsincerity or good intentions in the choice of his.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made,\\r\\nto the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doing\\r\\nnothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It is\\r\\nindolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a want of\\r\\nall laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination\\r\\nto take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen.\\r\\nA clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish--read the\\r\\nnewspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his wife. His curate does\\r\\nall the work, and the business of his own life is to dine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so common\\r\\nas to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character. I\\r\\nsuspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure,\\r\\nyou are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whose\\r\\nopinions you have been in the habit of hearing. It is impossible that\\r\\nyour own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy.\\r\\nYou can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men\\r\\nyou condemn so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told at\\r\\nyour uncle's table.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion\\r\\nis general, it is usually correct. Though _I_ have not seen much of\\r\\nthe domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any\\r\\ndeficiency of information.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are\\r\\ncondemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information,\\r\\nor (smiling) of something else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals,\\r\\nperhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad,\\r\\nthey were always wishing away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor William! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the\\r\\nAntwerp,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was a tender apostrophe of Fanny's, very much to the purpose\\r\\nof her own feelings if not of the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Miss Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I can hardly suppose--and since you push me so\\r\\nhard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of seeing\\r\\nwhat clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my own\\r\\nbrother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to\\r\\nme, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good scholar\\r\\nand clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable,\\r\\n_I_ see him to be an indolent, selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who must have\\r\\nhis palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger for the\\r\\nconvenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder,\\r\\nis out of humour with his excellent wife. To own the truth, Henry and\\r\\nI were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a\\r\\ngreen goose, which he could not get the better of. My poor sister was\\r\\nforced to stay and bear it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great\\r\\ndefect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence;\\r\\nand to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to\\r\\nsuch feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt to\\r\\ndefend Dr. Grant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut we need not give up his profession for all\\r\\nthat; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have\\r\\ntaken a--not a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy\\r\\nor army, have had a great many more people under his command than he\\r\\nhas now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or\\r\\nsoldier than as a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that whatever\\r\\nthere may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater\\r\\ndanger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession, where\\r\\nhe would have had less time and obligation--where he might have escaped\\r\\nthat knowledge of himself, the _frequency_, at least, of that knowledge\\r\\nwhich it is impossible he should escape as he is now. A man--a sensible\\r\\nman like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty\\r\\nevery week, cannot go to church twice every Sunday, and preach such very\\r\\ngood sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being the better\\r\\nfor it himself. It must make him think; and I have no doubt that he\\r\\noftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been\\r\\nanything but a clergyman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better\\r\\nfate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness\\r\\ndepends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a\\r\\ngood-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling\\r\\nabout green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund\\r\\naffectionately, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmust be beyond the reach of any sermons.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time\\r\\nto say, in a pleasant manner, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI fancy Miss Price has been more used to\\r\\ndeserve praise than to hear it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; when, being earnestly invited by the\\r\\nMiss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,\\r\\nleaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her\\r\\nmany virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful\\r\\ntread.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere goes good-humour, I am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he presently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere goes a\\r\\ntemper which would never give pain! How well she walks! and how readily\\r\\nshe falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment she\\r\\nis asked. What a pity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, after an instant's reflection, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nshe should have been in such hands!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the\\r\\nwindow with her, in spite of the expected glee; and of having his eyes\\r\\nsoon turned, like hers, towards the scene without, where all that was\\r\\nsolemn, and soothing, and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an\\r\\nunclouded night, and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods. Fanny\\r\\nspoke her feelings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere's harmony!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9chere's repose! Here's\\r\\nwhat may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only\\r\\ncan attempt to describe! Here's what may tranquillise every care, and\\r\\nlift the heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, I\\r\\nfeel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world;\\r\\nand there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature\\r\\nwere more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves by\\r\\ncontemplating such a scene.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they\\r\\nare much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree,\\r\\nas you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in\\r\\nearly life. They lose a great deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_You_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had a very apt scholar. There's Arcturus looking very bright.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and the Bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot in the least. It is a great while since we have had any\\r\\nstar-gazing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; I do not know how it has happened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The glee began. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will stay\\r\\ntill this is finished, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, turning his back on the window;\\r\\nand as it advanced, she had the mortification of seeing him advance too,\\r\\nmoving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when it\\r\\nceased, he was close by the singers, among the most urgent in requesting\\r\\nto hear the glee again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris's\\r\\nthreats of catching cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas was to return in November, and his eldest son had duties to\\r\\ncall him earlier home. The approach of September brought tidings of Mr.\\r\\nBertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter\\r\\nto Edmund; and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay,\\r\\nagreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford\\r\\ndemanded; to tell of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, to\\r\\nwhich she might have listened six weeks before with some interest, and\\r\\naltogether to give her the fullest conviction, by the power of actual\\r\\ncomparison, of her preferring his younger brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it was;\\r\\nand so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even want\\r\\nto attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty\\r\\nrequired: his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything but\\r\\npleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clear\\r\\nthat he did not care about her; and his indifference was so much more\\r\\nthan equalled by her own, that were he now to step forth the owner of\\r\\nMansfield Park, the Sir Thomas complete, which he was to be in time, she\\r\\ndid not believe she could accept him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield took\\r\\nMr. Crawford into Norfolk. Everingham could not do without him in the\\r\\nbeginning of September. He went for a fortnight--a fortnight of such\\r\\ndullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their\\r\\nguard, and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister, the\\r\\nabsolute necessity of distrusting his attentions, and wishing him not\\r\\nto return; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals of\\r\\nshooting and sleeping, to have convinced the gentleman that he ought\\r\\nto keep longer away, had he been more in the habit of examining his own\\r\\nmotives, and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was\\r\\ntending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example,\\r\\nhe would not look beyond the present moment. The sisters, handsome,\\r\\nclever, and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind; and\\r\\nfinding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield,\\r\\nhe gladly returned to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed thither\\r\\nquite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with further.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to the\\r\\nrepeated details of his day's sport, good or bad, his boast of his dogs,\\r\\nhis jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their qualifications,\\r\\nand his zeal after poachers, subjects which will not find their way to\\r\\nfemale feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on\\r\\nthe other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and Julia, unengaged and\\r\\nunemployed, felt all the right of missing him much more. Each sister\\r\\nbelieved herself the favourite. Julia might be justified in so doing by\\r\\nthe hints of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit what she wished, and Maria\\r\\nby the hints of Mr. Crawford himself. Everything returned into the same\\r\\nchannel as before his absence; his manners being to each so animated and\\r\\nagreeable as to lose no ground with either, and just stopping short of\\r\\nthe consistence, the steadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which\\r\\nmight excite general notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike; but\\r\\nsince the day at Sotherton, she could never see Mr. Crawford with either\\r\\nsister without observation, and seldom without wonder or censure; and\\r\\nhad her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it\\r\\nin every other respect, had she been sure that she was seeing clearly,\\r\\nand judging candidly, she would probably have made some important\\r\\ncommunications to her usual confidant. As it was, however, she only\\r\\nhazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am rather surprised,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nshe, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon, after being here\\r\\nso long before, full seven weeks; for I had understood he was so\\r\\nvery fond of change and moving about, that I thought something would\\r\\ncertainly occur, when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere. He is\\r\\nused to much gayer places than Mansfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is to his credit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Edmund's answer; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I dare say it gives his\\r\\nsister pleasure. She does not like his unsettled habits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a favourite he is with my cousins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, his manners to women are such as must please. Mrs. Grant, I\\r\\nbelieve, suspects him of a preference for Julia; I have never seen much\\r\\nsymptom of it, but I wish it may be so. He has no faults but what a\\r\\nserious attachment would remove.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Miss Bertram were not engaged,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny cautiously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could\\r\\nsometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you,\\r\\nFanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, before\\r\\nhe has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or\\r\\nintimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the\\r\\nwoman herself. Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found\\r\\nhimself in any danger from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her,\\r\\nafter such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think\\r\\ndifferently in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could\\r\\ndo, and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she\\r\\noccasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say that\\r\\nJulia was Mr. Crawford's choice, she knew not always what to think. She\\r\\nwas privy, one evening, to the hopes of her aunt Norris on the subject,\\r\\nas well as to her feelings, and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth, on a\\r\\npoint of some similarity, and could not help wondering as she listened;\\r\\nand glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen, for it was\\r\\nwhile all the other young people were dancing, and she sitting,\\r\\nmost unwillingly, among the chaperons at the fire, longing for the\\r\\nre-entrance of her elder cousin, on whom all her own hopes of a partner\\r\\nthen depended. It was Fanny's first ball, though without the preparation\\r\\nor splendour of many a young lady's first ball, being the thought only\\r\\nof the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of a violin player in\\r\\nthe servants' hall, and the possibility of raising five couple with\\r\\nthe help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr. Bertram's just\\r\\narrived on a visit. It had, however, been a very happy one to Fanny\\r\\nthrough four dances, and she was quite grieved to be losing even a\\r\\nquarter of an hour. While waiting and wishing, looking now at\\r\\nthe dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the two\\r\\nabove-mentioned ladies was forced on her--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think, ma'am,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed towards Mr.\\r\\nRushworth and Maria, who were partners for the second time, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe shall\\r\\nsee some happy faces again now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, ma'am, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied the other, with a stately simper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\r\\nwill be some satisfaction in looking on _now_, and I think it was rather\\r\\na pity they should have been obliged to part. Young folks in their\\r\\nsituation should be excused complying with the common forms. I wonder my\\r\\nson did not propose it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say he did, ma'am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss. But dear Maria\\r\\nhas such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true delicacy\\r\\nwhich one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth--that wish of\\r\\navoiding particularity! Dear ma'am, only look at her face at this\\r\\nmoment; how different from what it was the two last dances!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were sparkling with\\r\\npleasure, and she was speaking with great animation, for Julia and her\\r\\npartner, Mr. Crawford, were close to her; they were all in a cluster\\r\\ntogether. How she had looked before, Fanny could not recollect, for she\\r\\nhad been dancing with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is quite delightful, ma'am, to see young\\r\\npeople so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing! I\\r\\ncannot but think of dear Sir Thomas's delight. And what do you say,\\r\\nma'am, to the chance of another match? Mr. Rushworth has set a good\\r\\nexample, and such things are very catching.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth, who saw nothing but her son, was quite at a loss.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe couple above, ma'am. Do you see no symptoms there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford. Yes, indeed, a very pretty match.\\r\\nWhat is his property?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour thousand a year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well. Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they\\r\\nhave. Four thousand a year is a pretty estate, and he seems a very\\r\\ngenteel, steady young man, so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not a settled thing, ma'am, yet. We only speak of it among\\r\\nfriends. But I have very little doubt it _will_ be. He is growing\\r\\nextremely particular in his attentions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny could listen no farther. Listening and wondering were all\\r\\nsuspended for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again; and though\\r\\nfeeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought it\\r\\nmust happen. He came towards their little circle; but instead of asking\\r\\nher to dance, drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of the\\r\\npresent state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom, from\\r\\nwhom he had just parted. Fanny found that it was not to be, and in the\\r\\nmodesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable\\r\\nin expecting it. When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper from\\r\\nthe table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you want to\\r\\ndance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d With more than equal civility\\r\\nthe offer was declined; she did not wish to dance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said he, in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the newspaper again,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor I am tired to death. I only wonder how the good people can keep\\r\\nit up so long. They had need be _all_ in love, to find any amusement in\\r\\nsuch folly; and so they are, I fancy. If you look at them you may see\\r\\nthey are so many couple of lovers--all but Yates and Mrs. Grant--and,\\r\\nbetween ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a lover as much as any one\\r\\nof them. A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d making\\r\\na sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the latter, who proving,\\r\\nhowever, to be close at his elbow, made so instantaneous a change of\\r\\nexpression and subject necessary, as Fanny, in spite of everything,\\r\\ncould hardly help laughing at. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA strange business this in America, Dr.\\r\\nGrant! What is your opinion? I always come to you to know what I am to\\r\\nthink of public matters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Tom,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried his aunt soon afterwards, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas you are not dancing,\\r\\nI dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall\\r\\nyou?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then leaving her seat, and coming to him to enforce the proposal,\\r\\nadded in a whisper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth, you\\r\\nknow. Your mother is quite anxious about it, but cannot very well spare\\r\\ntime to sit down herself, because of her fringe. Now, you and I and Dr.\\r\\nGrant will just do; and though _we_ play but half-crowns, you know, you\\r\\nmay bet half-guineas with _him_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should be most happy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied he aloud, and jumping up with\\r\\nalacrity, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit would give me the greatest pleasure; but that I am\\r\\nthis moment going to dance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Come, Fanny, taking her hand, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo not be\\r\\ndawdling any longer, or the dance will be over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her to\\r\\nfeel much gratitude towards her cousin, or distinguish, as he certainly\\r\\ndid, between the selfishness of another person and his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA pretty modest request upon my word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he indignantly exclaimed as they\\r\\nwalked away. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo want to nail me to a card-table for the next two hours\\r\\nwith herself and Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that poking\\r\\nold woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra. I wish my good\\r\\naunt would be a little less busy! And to ask me in such a way too!\\r\\nwithout ceremony, before them all, so as to leave me no possibility\\r\\nof refusing. _That_ is what I dislike most particularly. It raises my\\r\\nspleen more than anything, to have the pretence of being asked, of\\r\\nbeing given a choice, and at the same time addressed in such a way as\\r\\nto oblige one to do the very thing, whatever it be! If I had not luckily\\r\\nthought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it. It is\\r\\na great deal too bad. But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head,\\r\\nnothing can stop her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much to recommend\\r\\nhim beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being the younger son of\\r\\na lord with a tolerable independence; and Sir Thomas would probably\\r\\nhave thought his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable. Mr.\\r\\nBertram's acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth, where they had\\r\\nspent ten days together in the same society, and the friendship, if\\r\\nfriendship it might be called, had been proved and perfected by Mr.\\r\\nYates's being invited to take Mansfield in his way, whenever he could,\\r\\nand by his promising to come; and he did come rather earlier than had\\r\\nbeen expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up of a large party\\r\\nassembled for gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had left\\r\\nWeymouth to join. He came on the wings of disappointment, and with his\\r\\nhead full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party; and the play\\r\\nin which he had borne a part was within two days of representation,\\r\\nwhen the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the family\\r\\nhad destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers. To be so near\\r\\nhappiness, so near fame, so near the long paragraph in praise of the\\r\\nprivate theatricals at Ecclesford, the seat of the Right Hon. Lord\\r\\nRavenshaw, in Cornwall, which would of course have immortalised the\\r\\nwhole party for at least a twelvemonth! and being so near, to lose\\r\\nit all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates could talk of\\r\\nnothing else. Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements and\\r\\ndresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his never-failing subject, and to\\r\\nboast of the past his only consolation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for acting\\r\\nso strong among young people, that he could hardly out-talk the interest\\r\\nof his hearers. From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue it\\r\\nwas all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to have been a\\r\\nparty concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill. The play\\r\\nhad been Lovers' Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\r\\ntrifling part,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand not at all to my taste, and such a one\\r\\nas I certainly would not accept again; but I was determined to make no\\r\\ndifficulties. Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two\\r\\ncharacters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford; and though Lord\\r\\nRavenshaw offered to resign his to me, it was impossible to take it, you\\r\\nknow. I was sorry for _him_ that he should have so mistaken his powers,\\r\\nfor he was no more equal to the Baron--a little man with a weak voice,\\r\\nalways hoarse after the first ten minutes. It must have injured the\\r\\npiece materially; but _I_ was resolved to make no difficulties. Sir\\r\\nHenry thought the duke not equal to Frederick, but that was because\\r\\nSir Henry wanted the part himself; whereas it was certainly in the best\\r\\nhands of the two. I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckily\\r\\nthe strength of the piece did not depend upon him. Our Agatha was\\r\\ninimitable, and the duke was thought very great by many. And upon the\\r\\nwhole, it would certainly have gone off wonderfully.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a hard case, upon my word\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do think you were very much\\r\\nto be pitied,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were the kind responses of listening sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowager\\r\\ncould not have died at a worse time; and it is impossible to help\\r\\nwishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days\\r\\nwe wanted. It was but three days; and being only a grandmother, and all\\r\\nhappening two hundred miles off, I think there would have been no great\\r\\nharm, and it was suggested, I know; but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose is\\r\\none of the most correct men in England, would not hear of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn afterpiece instead of a comedy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Bertram. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLovers' Vows\\r\\nwere at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother\\r\\nby themselves. Well, the jointure may comfort _him_; and perhaps,\\r\\nbetween friends, he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the\\r\\nBaron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make _you_ amends, Yates, I\\r\\nthink we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield, and ask you to be our\\r\\nmanager.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, though the thought of the moment, did not end with the moment; for\\r\\nthe inclination to act was awakened, and in no one more strongly than in\\r\\nhim who was now master of the house; and who, having so much leisure as\\r\\nto make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise such a degree of\\r\\nlively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to the novelty\\r\\nof acting. The thought returned again and again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh for the Ecclesford\\r\\ntheatre and scenery to try something with.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Each sister could echo the\\r\\nwish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of his gratifications\\r\\nit was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really\\r\\nbelieve,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could be fool enough at this moment to undertake\\r\\nany character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to\\r\\nthe singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel\\r\\nas if I could be anything or everything; as if I could rant and storm,\\r\\nor sigh or cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy in the English language.\\r\\nLet us be doing something. Be it only half a play, an act, a scene; what\\r\\nshould prevent us? Not these countenances, I am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d looking towards\\r\\nthe Miss Bertrams; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand for a theatre, what signifies a theatre? We\\r\\nshall be only amusing ourselves. Any room in this house might suffice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must have a curtain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom Bertram; \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca few yards of green baize\\r\\nfor a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, quite enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Yates, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith only just a side wing or two\\r\\nrun up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down; nothing\\r\\nmore would be necessary on such a plan as this. For mere amusement among\\r\\nourselves we should want nothing more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe we must be satisfied with _less_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Maria. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere would\\r\\nnot be time, and other difficulties would arise. We must rather adopt\\r\\nMr. Crawford's views, and make the _performance_, not the _theatre_, our\\r\\nobject. Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us do nothing\\r\\nby halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted\\r\\nup with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from\\r\\nbeginning to end; so as it be a German play, no matter what, with a good\\r\\ntricking, shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe, and a\\r\\nsong between the acts. If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do nothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Edmund, do not be disagreeable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Julia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody loves a play\\r\\nbetter than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but I would hardly\\r\\nwalk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who\\r\\nhave not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have\\r\\nall the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was\\r\\ndiscussed with unabated eagerness, every one's inclination increasing\\r\\nby the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; and\\r\\nthough nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy,\\r\\nand his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the\\r\\nworld could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all,\\r\\nthe resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to\\r\\nmake Edmund quite uncomfortable. He was determined to prevent it, if\\r\\npossible, though his mother, who equally heard the conversation which\\r\\npassed at table, did not evince the least disapprobation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying his strength.\\r\\nMaria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates were in the billiard-room.\\r\\nTom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was\\r\\nstanding thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at\\r\\na little distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work, thus\\r\\nbegan as he entered--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch a horribly vile billiard-table as ours is not\\r\\nto be met with, I believe, above ground. I can stand it no longer, and I\\r\\nthink, I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again; but one\\r\\ngood thing I have just ascertained: it is the very room for a theatre,\\r\\nprecisely the shape and length for it; and the doors at the farther\\r\\nend, communicating with each other, as they may be made to do in five\\r\\nminutes, by merely moving the bookcase in my father's room, is the very\\r\\nthing we could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it; and\\r\\nmy father's room will be an excellent greenroom. It seems to join the\\r\\nbilliard-room on purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, in a low\\r\\nvoice, as his brother approached the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot serious! never more so, I assure you. What is there to surprise you\\r\\nin it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it would be very wrong. In a _general_ light, private\\r\\ntheatricals are open to some objections, but as _we_ are circumstanced,\\r\\nI must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudicious\\r\\nto attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of feeling\\r\\non my father's account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constant\\r\\ndanger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose\\r\\nsituation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely\\r\\ndelicate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going to act three\\r\\ntimes a week till my father's return, and invite all the country. But\\r\\nit is not to be a display of that sort. We mean nothing but a little\\r\\namusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our\\r\\npowers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be\\r\\ntrusted, I think, in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable;\\r\\nand I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing\\r\\nin the elegant written language of some respectable author than in\\r\\nchattering in words of our own. I have no fears and no scruples. And\\r\\nas to my father's being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I\\r\\nconsider it rather as a motive; for the expectation of his return must\\r\\nbe a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can be the means of\\r\\namusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks,\\r\\nI shall think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will he. It\\r\\nis a _very_ anxious period for her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he said this, each looked towards their mother. Lady Bertram, sunk\\r\\nback in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease,\\r\\nand tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was\\r\\ngetting through the few difficulties of her work for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund smiled and shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy Jove! this won't do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Tom, throwing himself into a chair with\\r\\na hearty laugh. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety--I was unlucky\\r\\nthere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked her ladyship, in the heavy tone of one\\r\\nhalf-roused; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was not asleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear, no, ma'am, nobody suspected you! Well, Edmund,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued,\\r\\nreturning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as Lady\\r\\nBertram began to nod again, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut _this_ I _will_ maintain, that we shall\\r\\nbe doing no harm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father would totally\\r\\ndisapprove it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I am convinced to the contrary. Nobody is fonder of the exercise\\r\\nof talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and for\\r\\nanything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always a\\r\\ndecided taste. I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys. How many a time\\r\\nhave we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar, and to _be'd_ and\\r\\nnot _to_ _be'd_, in this very room, for his amusement? And I am sure,\\r\\n_my_ _name_ _was_ _Norval_, every evening of my life through one\\r\\nChristmas holidays.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a very different thing. You must see the difference yourself. My\\r\\nfather wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would never\\r\\nwish his grown-up daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum is\\r\\nstrict.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know all that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom, displeased. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know my father as well as\\r\\nyou do; and I'll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress\\r\\nhim. Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I'll take care of the rest of\\r\\nthe family.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you are resolved on acting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied the persevering Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must\\r\\nhope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and I think a theatre\\r\\nought not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my father's\\r\\nhouse in his absence which could not be justified.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor everything of that nature I will be answerable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom, in a\\r\\ndecided tone. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great an\\r\\ninterest in being careful of his house as you can have; and as to such\\r\\nalterations as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, or\\r\\nunlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of a\\r\\nweek without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well suppose\\r\\nhe would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the\\r\\nbreakfast-room, than we did before he went away, or to my sister's\\r\\npianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. Absolute\\r\\nnonsense!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as an\\r\\nexpense.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! Perhaps\\r\\nit might cost a whole twenty pounds. Something of a theatre we must have\\r\\nundoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and a\\r\\nlittle carpenter's work, and that's all; and as the carpenter's work\\r\\nmay be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be\\r\\ntoo absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed,\\r\\neverything will be right with Sir Thomas. Don't imagine that nobody in\\r\\nthis house can see or judge but yourself. Don't act yourself, if you do\\r\\nnot like it, but don't expect to govern everybody else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, as to acting myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_that_ I absolutely protest\\r\\nagainst.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTom walked out of the room as he said it, and Edmund was left to sit\\r\\ndown and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company in every feeling\\r\\nthroughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggest\\r\\nsome comfort, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit\\r\\nthem. Your brother's taste and your sisters' seem very different.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no hope there, Fanny. If they persist in the scheme, they will\\r\\nfind something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _them_,\\r\\nand that is all I can do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should think my aunt Norris would be on your side.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say she would, but she has no influence with either Tom or my\\r\\nsisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself,\\r\\nI shall let things take their course, without attempting it through\\r\\nher. Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do\\r\\nanything than be altogether by the ears.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning,\\r\\nwere quite as impatient of his advice, quite as unyielding to his\\r\\nrepresentation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as Tom.\\r\\nTheir mother had no objection to the plan, and they were not in the\\r\\nleast afraid of their father's disapprobation. There could be no harm in\\r\\nwhat had been done in so many respectable families, and by so many women\\r\\nof the first consideration; and it must be scrupulousness run mad that\\r\\ncould see anything to censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending only\\r\\nbrothers and sisters and intimate friends, and which would never be\\r\\nheard of beyond themselves. Julia _did_ seem inclined to admit that\\r\\nMaria's situation might require particular caution and delicacy--but\\r\\nthat could not extend to _her_--she was at liberty; and Maria evidently\\r\\nconsidered her engagement as only raising her so much more above\\r\\nrestraint, and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either\\r\\nfather or mother. Edmund had little to hope, but he was still urging the\\r\\nsubject when Henry Crawford entered the room, fresh from the Parsonage,\\r\\ncalling out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram. No want\\r\\nof understrappers: my sister desires her love, and hopes to be admitted\\r\\ninto the company, and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna\\r\\nor tame confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat say you now? Can we\\r\\nbe wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And Edmund, silenced,\\r\\nwas obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry\\r\\nfascination to the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to\\r\\ndwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than on\\r\\nanything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scheme advanced. Opposition was vain; and as to Mrs. Norris, he\\r\\nwas mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any. She started no\\r\\ndifficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest\\r\\nnephew and niece, who were all-powerful with her; and as the whole\\r\\narrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody, and none at all\\r\\nto herself, as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle,\\r\\nand importance, and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself\\r\\nobliged to leave her own house, where she had been living a month at\\r\\nher own cost, and take up her abode in theirs, that every hour might be\\r\\nspent in their service, she was, in fact, exceedingly delighted with the\\r\\nproject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed. The business\\r\\nof finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle; and\\r\\nthe carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements, had\\r\\nsuggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having made\\r\\nthe necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident, was\\r\\nalready at work, while a play was still to seek. Other preparations\\r\\nwere also in hand. An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from\\r\\nNorthampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her good\\r\\nmanagement of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming\\r\\ninto a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and\\r\\nas two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to\\r\\nhope that none might ever be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people\\r\\nto be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a\\r\\nneed that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that there\\r\\ndid seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and\\r\\nzeal could hold out.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford, and Mr.\\r\\nYates; on the comic, Tom Bertram, not _quite_ alone, because it was\\r\\nevident that Mary Crawford's wishes, though politely kept back, inclined\\r\\nthe same way: but his determinateness and his power seemed to make\\r\\nallies unnecessary; and, independent of this great irreconcilable\\r\\ndifference, they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the\\r\\nwhole, but every character first-rate, and three principal women. All\\r\\nthe best plays were run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor\\r\\nOthello, nor Douglas, nor The Gamester, presented anything that could\\r\\nsatisfy even the tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal,\\r\\nWheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera, were successively\\r\\ndismissed with yet warmer objections. No piece could be proposed that\\r\\ndid not supply somebody with a difficulty, and on one side or the other\\r\\nit was a continual repetition of, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no, _that_ will never do! Let us\\r\\nhave no ranting tragedies. Too many characters. Not a tolerable\\r\\nwoman's part in the play. Anything but _that_, my dear Tom. It would be\\r\\nimpossible to fill it up. One could not expect anybody to take such a\\r\\npart. Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end. _That_ might do,\\r\\nperhaps, but for the low parts. If I _must_ give my opinion, I have\\r\\nalways thought it the most insipid play in the English language. _I_ do\\r\\nnot wish to make objections; I shall be happy to be of any use, but I\\r\\nthink we could not chuse worse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness\\r\\nwhich, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wondering\\r\\nhow it would end. For her own gratification she could have wished that\\r\\nsomething might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play, but\\r\\neverything of higher consequence was against it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis will never do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom Bertram at last. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are wasting time\\r\\nmost abominably. Something must be fixed on. No matter what, so that\\r\\nsomething is chosen. We must not be so nice. A few characters too many\\r\\nmust not frighten us. We must _double_ them. We must descend a little.\\r\\nIf a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything of\\r\\nit. From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you chuse\\r\\nto give me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition for\\r\\nnothing more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law, doubting only\\r\\nwhether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself; and very\\r\\nearnestly, but very unsuccessfully, trying to persuade the others that\\r\\nthere were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the dramatis personae.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same\\r\\nspeaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the\\r\\ntable, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLovers' Vows! And why\\r\\nshould not Lovers' Vows do for _us_ as well as for the Ravenshaws? How\\r\\ncame it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if it would do\\r\\nexactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts for Yates\\r\\nand Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody else\\r\\nwants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not dislike,\\r\\nand, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do my best.\\r\\nAnd as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is only Count\\r\\nCassel and Anhalt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suggestion was generally welcome. Everybody was growing weary of\\r\\nindecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had been\\r\\nproposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was particularly\\r\\npleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford,\\r\\nhad grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw's, and been forced to re-rant\\r\\nit all in his own room. The storm through Baron Wildenheim was the\\r\\nheight of his theatrical ambition; and with the advantage of knowing\\r\\nhalf the scenes by heart already, he did now, with the greatest\\r\\nalacrity, offer his services for the part. To do him justice, however,\\r\\nhe did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering that there was\\r\\nsome very good ranting-ground in Frederick, he professed an equal\\r\\nwillingness for that. Henry Crawford was ready to take either. Whichever\\r\\nMr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him, and a short parley\\r\\nof compliment ensued. Miss Bertram, feeling all the interest of an\\r\\nAgatha in the question, took on her to decide it, by observing to Mr.\\r\\nYates that this was a point in which height and figure ought to\\r\\nbe considered, and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit him\\r\\npeculiarly for the Baron. She was acknowledged to be quite right, and\\r\\nthe two parts being accepted accordingly, she was certain of the proper\\r\\nFrederick. Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr. Rushworth,\\r\\nwho was always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything; when\\r\\nJulia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to be scrupulous on\\r\\nMiss Crawford's account.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not behaving well by the absent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere are not women\\r\\nenough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is nothing\\r\\nfor your sister, Mr. Crawford.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he was very sure\\r\\nhis sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and that\\r\\nshe would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. But\\r\\nthis was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of\\r\\nAmelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she\\r\\nwould accept it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt falls as naturally, as necessarily to her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas Agatha does to one or other of my sisters. It can be no\\r\\nsacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each felt the\\r\\nbest claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her by the\\r\\nrest. Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with\\r\\nseeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled the\\r\\nbusiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must entreat Miss _Julia_ Bertram,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot to engage in the\\r\\npart of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You must\\r\\nnot, indeed you must not\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (turning to her). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could not stand your\\r\\ncountenance dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have had\\r\\ntogether would infallibly come across me, and Frederick and his knapsack\\r\\nwould be obliged to run away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in the\\r\\nmatter to Julia's feelings. She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed\\r\\nthe injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted, Maria\\r\\nwas preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress\\r\\nshewed how well it was understood; and before Julia could command\\r\\nherself enough to speak, her brother gave his weight against her too,\\r\\nby saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes! Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the best Agatha.\\r\\nThough Julia fancies she prefers tragedy, I would not trust her in it.\\r\\nThere is nothing of tragedy about her. She has not the look of it. Her\\r\\nfeatures are not tragic features, and she walks too quick, and speaks\\r\\ntoo quick, and would not keep her countenance. She had better do the old\\r\\ncountrywoman: the Cottager's wife; you had, indeed, Julia. Cottager's\\r\\nwife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The old lady relieves the\\r\\nhigh-flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit. You\\r\\nshall be Cottager's wife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCottager's wife!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Yates. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are you talking of? The most\\r\\ntrivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not a\\r\\ntolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do that! It is an insult\\r\\nto propose it. At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it. We\\r\\nall agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else. A little more\\r\\njustice, Mr. Manager, if you please. You do not deserve the office, if\\r\\nyou cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company have really\\r\\nacted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to\\r\\nJulia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager's\\r\\nwife; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being\\r\\nsatisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will have\\r\\nmore credit in making something of it; and if she is so desperately bent\\r\\nagainst everything humorous, let her take Cottager's speeches instead of\\r\\nCottager's wife's, and so change the parts all through; _he_ is solemn\\r\\nand pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference in the play,\\r\\nand as for Cottager himself, when he has got his wife's speeches, _I_\\r\\nwould undertake him with all my heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith all your partiality for Cottager's wife,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Henry Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\r\\nwill be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and we\\r\\nmust not suffer her good-nature to be imposed on. We must not _allow_\\r\\nher to accept the part. She must not be left to her own complaisance.\\r\\nHer talents will be wanted in Amelia. Amelia is a character more\\r\\ndifficult to be well represented than even Agatha. I consider Amelia\\r\\nis the most difficult character in the whole piece. It requires great\\r\\npowers, great nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity without\\r\\nextravagance. I have seen good actresses fail in the part. Simplicity,\\r\\nindeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession.\\r\\nIt requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not. It requires a\\r\\ngentlewoman--a Julia Bertram. You _will_ undertake it, I hope?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d turning\\r\\nto her with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened her a little; but\\r\\nwhile she hesitated what to say, her brother again interposed with Miss\\r\\nCrawford's better claim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for her.\\r\\nShe would not like it. She would not do well. She is too tall and\\r\\nrobust. Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It is\\r\\nfit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She looks the part, and I\\r\\nam persuaded will do it admirably.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout attending to this, Henry Crawford continued his supplication.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must oblige us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindeed you must. When you have studied\\r\\nthe character, I am sure you will feel it suit you. Tragedy may be your\\r\\nchoice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_. You\\r\\nwill be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will\\r\\nnot refuse to visit me in prison? I think I see you coming in with your\\r\\nbasket.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influence of his voice was felt. Julia wavered; but was he only\\r\\ntrying to soothe and pacify her, and make her overlook the previous\\r\\naffront? She distrusted him. The slight had been most determined. He\\r\\nwas, perhaps, but at treacherous play with her. She looked suspiciously\\r\\nat her sister; Maria's countenance was to decide it: if she were vexed\\r\\nand alarmed--but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Julia\\r\\nwell knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her\\r\\nexpense. With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she\\r\\nsaid to him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance\\r\\nwhen I come in with a basket of provisions--though one might have\\r\\nsupposed--but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n She stopped--Henry Crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he did not\\r\\nknow what to say. Tom Bertram began again--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Crawford must be Amelia. She will be an excellent Amelia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Julia, with\\r\\nangry quickness: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am _not_ to be Agatha, and I am sure I will do\\r\\nnothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world the\\r\\nmost disgusting to me. I quite detest her. An odious, little, pert,\\r\\nunnatural, impudent girl. I have always protested against comedy, and\\r\\nthis is comedy in its worst form.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And so saying, she walked hastily\\r\\nout of the room, leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but exciting\\r\\nsmall compassion in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of\\r\\nthe whole, and who could not think of her as under the agitations of\\r\\n_jealousy_ without great pity.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother soon\\r\\nreturned to business and Lovers' Vows, and was eagerly looking over\\r\\nthe play, with Mr. Yates's help, to ascertain what scenery would be\\r\\nnecessary--while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an\\r\\nunder-voice, and the declaration with which she began of, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure I\\r\\nwould give up the part to Julia most willingly, but that though I shall\\r\\nprobably do it very ill, I feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was\\r\\ndoubtless receiving all the compliments it called for.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed\\r\\nby Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in\\r\\nthe room now beginning to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram's\\r\\nresolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia\\r\\nto Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume which\\r\\nhad been left on the table, and begin to acquaint herself with the play\\r\\nof which she had heard so much. Her curiosity was all awake, and she ran\\r\\nthrough it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals of\\r\\nastonishment, that it could be chosen in the present instance, that it\\r\\ncould be proposed and accepted in a private theatre! Agatha and Amelia\\r\\nappeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home\\r\\nrepresentation--the situation of one, and the language of the other,\\r\\nso unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she could hardly\\r\\nsuppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in; and\\r\\nlonged to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which\\r\\nEdmund would certainly make.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after Miss\\r\\nBertram's return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth arrived, and another\\r\\ncharacter was consequently cast. He had the offer of Count Cassel\\r\\nand Anhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse, and wanted Miss\\r\\nBertram to direct him; but upon being made to understand the different\\r\\nstyle of the characters, and which was which, and recollecting that he\\r\\nhad once seen the play in London, and had thought Anhalt a very stupid\\r\\nfellow, he soon decided for the Count. Miss Bertram approved the\\r\\ndecision, for the less he had to learn the better; and though she could\\r\\nnot sympathise in his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act\\r\\ntogether, nor wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over the\\r\\nleaves with the hope of still discovering such a scene, she very kindly\\r\\ntook his part in hand, and curtailed every speech that admitted being\\r\\nshortened; besides pointing out the necessity of his being very much\\r\\ndressed, and chusing his colours. Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his\\r\\nfinery very well, though affecting to despise it; and was too much\\r\\nengaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others,\\r\\nor draw any of those conclusions, or feel any of that displeasure which\\r\\nMaria had been half prepared for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,\\r\\nknew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room before\\r\\ndinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and Mr.\\r\\nYates; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him\\r\\nthe agreeable news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have got a play,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is to be Lovers' Vows; and I am to be\\r\\nCount Cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin\\r\\ncloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of a\\r\\nshooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him as she heard\\r\\nthis speech, and saw his look, and felt what his sensations must be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLovers' Vows!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a tone of the greatest amazement, was his only reply\\r\\nto Mr. Rushworth, and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if\\r\\nhardly doubting a contradiction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Yates. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter all our debatings and difficulties, we\\r\\nfind there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing so\\r\\nunexceptionable, as Lovers' Vows. The wonder is that it should not have\\r\\nbeen thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we have\\r\\nall the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford; and it is so useful to\\r\\nhave anything of a model! We have cast almost every part.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what do you do for women?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund gravely, and looking at\\r\\nMaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI take the part\\r\\nwhich Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (with a bolder eye) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss\\r\\nCrawford is to be Amelia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled\\r\\nup, with _us_,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat\\r\\nhis mother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great\\r\\nvexation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Rushworth followed him to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI come in three times, and have\\r\\ntwo-and-forty speeches. That's something, is not it? But I do not much\\r\\nlike the idea of being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a blue\\r\\ndress and a pink satin cloak.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund could not answer him. In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called\\r\\nout of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and being\\r\\naccompanied by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth,\\r\\nEdmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot,\\r\\nbefore Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without reflecting\\r\\non his friends at Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria, tell _you_,\\r\\nthat I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation, and that I\\r\\nhope you will give it up. I cannot but suppose you _will_ when you have\\r\\nread it carefully over. Read only the first act aloud to either your\\r\\nmother or aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be necessary\\r\\nto send you to your _father's_ judgment, I am convinced.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe see things very differently,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Maria. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am perfectly\\r\\nacquainted with the play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions,\\r\\nand so forth, which will be made, of course, I can see nothing\\r\\nobjectionable in it; and _I_ am not the _only_ young woman you find who\\r\\nthinks it very fit for private representation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry for it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his answer; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut in this matter it is _you_ who\\r\\nare to lead. _You_ must set the example. If others have blundered, it\\r\\nis your place to put them right, and shew them what true delicacy is.\\r\\nIn all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of the\\r\\nparty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved better\\r\\nto lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\nmuch obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I still\\r\\nthink you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake to\\r\\nharangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind. _There_ would be the\\r\\ngreatest indecorum, I think.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head? No; let your\\r\\nconduct be the only harangue. Say that, on examining the part, you feel\\r\\nyourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion and\\r\\nconfidence than you can be supposed to have. Say this with firmness, and\\r\\nit will be quite enough. All who can distinguish will understand your\\r\\nmotive. The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as it\\r\\nought.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not act anything improper, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas\\r\\nwould not like it.--Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.--To be\\r\\nsure, Julia is dressed by this time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am convinced, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, preventing Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Sir Thomas\\r\\nwould not like it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I were to decline the part,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Maria, with renewed zeal, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJulia\\r\\nwould certainly take it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif she knew your reasons!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! she might think the difference between us--the difference in our\\r\\nsituations--that _she_ need not be so scrupulous as _I_ might feel\\r\\nnecessary. I am sure she would argue so. No; you must excuse me; I\\r\\ncannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be so\\r\\ndisappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we\\r\\nshall never act anything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was just going to say the very same thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Norris.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the\\r\\npreparations will be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure _that_\\r\\nwould be a discredit to us all. I do not know the play; but, as Maria\\r\\nsays, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most of\\r\\nthem) it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise, Edmund. As\\r\\nMr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only wish Tom had\\r\\nknown his own mind when the carpenters began, for there was the loss\\r\\nof half a day's work about those side-doors. The curtain will be a good\\r\\njob, however. The maids do their work very well, and I think we shall be\\r\\nable to send back some dozens of the rings. There is no occasion to put\\r\\nthem so very close together. I _am_ of some use, I hope, in preventing\\r\\nwaste and making the most of things. There should always be one\\r\\nsteady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot to tell Tom of\\r\\nsomething that happened to me this very day. I had been looking about me\\r\\nin the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who should I see but\\r\\nDick Jackson making up to the servants' hall-door with two bits of deal\\r\\nboard in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be sure; mother had\\r\\nchanced to send him of a message to father, and then father had bid\\r\\nhim bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no how do without\\r\\nthem. I knew what all this meant, for the servants' dinner-bell\\r\\nwas ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I hate such\\r\\nencroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have always\\r\\nsaid so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said to the boy\\r\\ndirectly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know, who ought\\r\\nto be ashamed of himself), '_I'll_ take the boards to your father, Dick,\\r\\nso get you home again as fast as you can.' The boy looked very silly,\\r\\nand turned away without offering a word, for I believe I might speak\\r\\npretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about\\r\\nthe house for one while. I hate such greediness--so good as your father\\r\\nis to the family, employing the man all the year round!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; and\\r\\nEdmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner passed heavily. Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick\\r\\nJackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked\\r\\nof, for Edmund's disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though\\r\\nhe would not have owned it. Maria, wanting Henry Crawford's animating\\r\\nsupport, thought the subject better avoided. Mr. Yates, who was trying\\r\\nto make himself agreeable to Julia, found her gloom less impenetrable on\\r\\nany topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company;\\r\\nand Mr. Rushworth, having only his own part and his own dress in his\\r\\nhead, had soon talked away all that could be said of either.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:\\r\\nthere was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening\\r\\ngiving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being\\r\\nreassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a\\r\\nseparate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting\\r\\ndeep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the\\r\\nentrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it\\r\\nwas, could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful\\r\\njoy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, how do you go on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat have you settled?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! we\\r\\ncan do nothing without you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d followed the first salutations; and Henry\\r\\nCrawford was soon seated with the other three at the table, while his\\r\\nsister made her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention was\\r\\ncomplimenting _her_. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must really congratulate your ladyship,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nshe, \\xe2\\x80\\x9con the play being chosen; for though you have borne it with\\r\\nexemplary patience, I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and\\r\\ndifficulties. The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be\\r\\ninfinitely more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give you\\r\\njoy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else who is in the\\r\\nsame predicament,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d glancing half fearfully, half slyly, beyond Fanny to\\r\\nEdmund.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram, but Edmund said nothing.\\r\\nHis being only a bystander was not disclaimed. After continuing in chat\\r\\nwith the party round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returned\\r\\nto the party round the table; and standing by them, seemed to\\r\\ninterest herself in their arrangements till, as if struck by a sudden\\r\\nrecollection, she exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy good friends, you are most composedly\\r\\nat work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let\\r\\nme know my fate in the meanwhile. Who is to be Anhalt? What gentleman\\r\\namong you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the same\\r\\nmelancholy truth, that they had not yet got any Anhalt. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Rushworth\\r\\nwas to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had my choice of the parts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Rushworth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I thought I\\r\\nshould like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am\\r\\nto have.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou chose very wisely, I am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Crawford, with a\\r\\nbrightened look; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnhalt is a heavy part.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Rushworth,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich is no trifle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not at all surprised,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, after a short pause,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cat this want of an Anhalt. Amelia deserves no better. Such a forward\\r\\nyoung lady may well frighten the men.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should be but too happy in taking the part, if it were possible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n cried Tom; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut, unluckily, the Butler and Anhalt are in together. I\\r\\nwill not entirely give it up, however; I will try what can be done--I\\r\\nwill look it over again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour _brother_ should take the part,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Yates, in a low voice.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not you think he would?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_I_ shall not ask him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Tom, in a cold, determined manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards rejoined the\\r\\nparty at the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey do not want me at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, seating herself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI only puzzle\\r\\nthem, and oblige them to make civil speeches. Mr. Edmund Bertram, as\\r\\nyou do not act yourself, you will be a disinterested adviser; and,\\r\\ntherefore, I apply to _you_. What shall we do for an Anhalt? Is it\\r\\npracticable for any of the others to double it? What is your advice?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy advice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he calmly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis that you change the play.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_I_ should have no objection,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor though I should not\\r\\nparticularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported, that is, if\\r\\neverything went well, I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but\\r\\nas they do not chuse to hear your advice at _that_ _table_\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (looking\\r\\nround), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit certainly will not be taken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf _any_ part could tempt _you_ to act, I suppose it would be Anhalt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n observed the lady archly, after a short pause; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor he is a clergyman,\\r\\nyou know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_That_ circumstance would by no means tempt me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor I\\r\\nshould be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting. It\\r\\nmust be very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn\\r\\nlecturer; and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one\\r\\nof the last who would wish to represent it on the stage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment and\\r\\nmortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the tea-table, and\\r\\ngave all her attention to Mrs. Norris, who was presiding there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Tom Bertram, from the other table, where the conference\\r\\nwas eagerly carrying on, and the conversation incessant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe want your\\r\\nservices.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was up in a moment, expecting some errand; for the habit of\\r\\nemploying her in that way was not yet overcome, in spite of all that\\r\\nEdmund could do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat. We do not want your\\r\\n_present_ services. We shall only want you in our play. You must be\\r\\nCottager's wife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed you must excuse me. I could not act anything if you were to give\\r\\nme the world. No, indeed, I cannot act.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you. It need not frighten\\r\\nyou: it is a nothing of a part, a mere nothing, not above half a dozen\\r\\nspeeches altogether, and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word\\r\\nyou say; so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must have you\\r\\nto look at.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you are afraid of half a dozen speeches,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Rushworth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\r\\nwould you do with such a part as mine? I have forty-two to learn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, shocked\\r\\nto find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to feel\\r\\nthat almost every eye was upon her; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I really cannot act.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, you can act well enough for _us_. Learn your part, and we\\r\\nwill teach you all the rest. You have only two scenes, and as I shall\\r\\nbe Cottager, I'll put you in and push you about, and you will do it very\\r\\nwell, I'll answer for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me. You cannot have an idea.\\r\\nIt would be absolutely impossible for me. If I were to undertake it, I\\r\\nshould only disappoint you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPhoo! Phoo! Do not be so shamefaced. You'll do it very well. Every\\r\\nallowance will be made for you. We do not expect perfection. You must\\r\\nget a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make\\r\\nyou a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your\\r\\neyes, and you will be a very proper, little old woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny, growing\\r\\nmore and more red from excessive agitation, and looking distressfully\\r\\nat Edmund, who was kindly observing her; but unwilling to exasperate\\r\\nhis brother by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile. Her\\r\\nentreaty had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had said\\r\\nbefore; and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed by\\r\\nMaria, and Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which differed\\r\\nfrom his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and which\\r\\naltogether was quite overpowering to Fanny; and before she could breathe\\r\\nafter it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a\\r\\nwhisper at once angry and audible--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a piece of work here is about\\r\\nnothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a difficulty of\\r\\nobliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort--so kind as they are to\\r\\nyou! Take the part with a good grace, and let us hear no more of the\\r\\nmatter, I entreat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not urge her, madam,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not fair to urge her\\r\\nin this manner. You see she does not like to act. Let her chuse for\\r\\nherself, as well as the rest of us. Her judgment may be quite as safely\\r\\ntrusted. Do not urge her any more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not going to urge her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Norris sharply; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I shall\\r\\nthink her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what her\\r\\naunt and cousins wish her--very ungrateful, indeed, considering who and\\r\\nwhat she is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment\\r\\nwith astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears were\\r\\nbeginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ndo not like my situation: this _place_ is too hot for me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and moved\\r\\naway her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to Fanny, saying\\r\\nto her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever mind,\\r\\nmy dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is cross and\\r\\nteasing, but do not let us mind them\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and with pointed attention\\r\\ncontinued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits, in spite of\\r\\nbeing out of spirits herself. By a look at her brother she prevented any\\r\\nfarther entreaty from the theatrical board, and the really good feelings\\r\\nby which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to\\r\\nall the little she had lost in Edmund's favour.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much obliged to her\\r\\nfor her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work,\\r\\nand wishing _she_ could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and\\r\\nsupposing Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of course she\\r\\nwould come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded to\\r\\ninquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said that\\r\\nshe had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine young\\r\\nman, and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea\\r\\nagain--she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery, or\\r\\nhelp listening, and answering with more animation than she had intended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss Crawford's\\r\\nattention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram's telling her,\\r\\nwith infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to\\r\\nundertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he had been most\\r\\nanxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not do;\\r\\nhe must give it up. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there will not be the smallest difficulty in\\r\\nfilling it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have but to speak the word; we may pick and\\r\\nchuse. I could name, at this moment, at least six young men within six\\r\\nmiles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company, and there are\\r\\none or two that would not disgrace us: I should not be afraid to trust\\r\\neither of the Olivers or Charles Maddox. Tom Oliver is a very clever\\r\\nfellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see\\r\\nanywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride over\\r\\nto Stoke, and settle with one of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full\\r\\nexpectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this:\\r\\nso contrary to all their first protestations; but Edmund said nothing.\\r\\nAfter a moment's thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs far as I\\r\\nam concerned, I can have no objection to anything that you all think\\r\\neligible. Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen? Yes, Mr. Charles\\r\\nMaddox dined at my sister's one day, did not he, Henry? A quiet-looking\\r\\nyoung man. I remember him. Let _him_ be applied to, if you please, for\\r\\nit will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Maddox was to be the man. Tom repeated his resolution of going\\r\\nto him early on the morrow; and though Julia, who had scarcely opened\\r\\nher lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glance\\r\\nfirst at Maria and then at Edmund, that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Mansfield theatricals would\\r\\nenliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Edmund still held his\\r\\npeace, and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not very sanguine as to our play,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, in an\\r\\nundervoice to Fanny, after some consideration; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I can tell Mr.\\r\\nMaddox that I shall shorten some of _his_ speeches, and a great many of\\r\\n_my_ _own_, before we rehearse together. It will be very disagreeable,\\r\\nand by no means what I expected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not in Miss Crawford's power to talk Fanny into any real\\r\\nforgetfulness of what had passed. When the evening was over, she went to\\r\\nbed full of it, her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack\\r\\nfrom her cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in, and her spirits\\r\\nsinking under her aunt's unkind reflection and reproach. To be called\\r\\ninto notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the prelude to\\r\\nsomething so infinitely worse, to be told that she must do what was\\r\\nso impossible as to act; and then to have the charge of obstinacy and\\r\\ningratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the dependence\\r\\nof her situation, had been too distressing at the time to make the\\r\\nremembrance when she was alone much less so, especially with the\\r\\nsuperadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation of the\\r\\nsubject. Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time; and if\\r\\nshe were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative\\r\\nurgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund perhaps away,\\r\\nwhat should she do? She fell asleep before she could answer the\\r\\nquestion, and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the next\\r\\nmorning. The little white attic, which had continued her sleeping-room\\r\\never since her first entering the family, proving incompetent to suggest\\r\\nany reply, she had recourse, as soon as she was dressed, to another\\r\\napartment more spacious and more meet for walking about in and thinking,\\r\\nand of which she had now for some time been almost equally mistress. It\\r\\nhad been their school-room; so called till the Miss Bertrams would not\\r\\nallow it to be called so any longer, and inhabited as such to a later\\r\\nperiod. There Miss Lee had lived, and there they had read and written,\\r\\nand talked and laughed, till within the last three years, when she had\\r\\nquitted them. The room had then become useless, and for some time was\\r\\nquite deserted, except by Fanny, when she visited her plants, or wanted\\r\\none of the books, which she was still glad to keep there, from the\\r\\ndeficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above: but\\r\\ngradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased, she had added\\r\\nto her possessions, and spent more of her time there; and having nothing\\r\\nto oppose her, had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it,\\r\\nthat it was now generally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it had\\r\\nbeen called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered\\r\\nFanny's, almost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the\\r\\none making the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss\\r\\nBertrams, with every superiority in their own apartments which their own\\r\\nsense of superiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs.\\r\\nNorris, having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny's\\r\\naccount, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody\\r\\nelse wanted, though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the\\r\\nindulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable\\r\\nin many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind\\r\\nas Fanny's; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be\\r\\ndriven from it entirely, even when winter came. The comfort of it in\\r\\nher hours of leisure was extreme. She could go there after anything\\r\\nunpleasant below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, or\\r\\nsome train of thought at hand. Her plants, her books--of which she had\\r\\nbeen a collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling--her\\r\\nwriting-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within\\r\\nher reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would\\r\\ndo, she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an\\r\\ninteresting remembrance connected with it. Everything was a friend, or\\r\\nbore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much\\r\\nof suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,\\r\\nher feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she\\r\\nhad known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost\\r\\nevery recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt\\r\\nBertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what\\r\\nwas yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and her\\r\\nfriend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had told\\r\\nher not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which made\\r\\nher tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together, so\\r\\nharmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm. The\\r\\nroom was most dear to her, and she would not have changed its furniture\\r\\nfor the handsomest in the house, though what had been originally plain\\r\\nhad suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its greatest elegancies\\r\\nand ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia's work, too ill done\\r\\nfor the drawing-room, three transparencies, made in a rage for\\r\\ntransparencies, for the three lower panes of one window, where Tintern\\r\\nAbbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in\\r\\nCumberland, a collection of family profiles, thought unworthy of being\\r\\nanywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their side, and pinned\\r\\nagainst the wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the\\r\\nMediterranean by William, with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom, in letters\\r\\nas tall as the mainmast.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on\\r\\nan agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at Edmund's profile\\r\\nshe could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums\\r\\nshe might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. But she had more\\r\\nthan fears of her own perseverance to remove: she had begun to feel\\r\\nundecided as to what she _ought_ _to_ _do_; and as she walked round the\\r\\nroom her doubts were increasing. Was she _right_ in refusing what was\\r\\nso warmly asked, so strongly wished for--what might be so essential to a\\r\\nscheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest complaisance\\r\\nhad set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness, and a fear of\\r\\nexposing herself? And would Edmund's judgment, would his persuasion of\\r\\nSir Thomas's disapprobation of the whole, be enough to justify her in a\\r\\ndetermined denial in spite of all the rest? It would be so horrible to\\r\\nher to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of her\\r\\nown scruples; and as she looked around her, the claims of her cousins\\r\\nto being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present upon present\\r\\nthat she had received from them. The table between the windows was\\r\\ncovered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which had been given her at\\r\\ndifferent times, principally by Tom; and she grew bewildered as to the\\r\\namount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced. A tap at\\r\\nthe door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to her\\r\\nduty, and her gentle \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was answered by the appearance of one,\\r\\nbefore whom all her doubts were wont to be laid. Her eyes brightened at\\r\\nthe sight of Edmund.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, certainly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to consult. I want your opinion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy opinion!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, shrinking from such a compliment, highly as it\\r\\ngratified her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, your advice and opinion. I do not know what to do. This acting\\r\\nscheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad a\\r\\nplay as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask\\r\\nthe help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the\\r\\nend of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first.\\r\\nI know no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which\\r\\nmust spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly\\r\\nobjectionable, the _more_ than intimacy--the familiarity. I cannot\\r\\nthink of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such\\r\\nmagnitude as must, _if_ _possible_, be prevented. Do not you see it in\\r\\nthe same light?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; but what can be done? Your brother is so determined.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is but _one_ thing to be done, Fanny. I must take Anhalt myself.\\r\\nI am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny could not answer him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not at all what I like,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo man can like being\\r\\ndriven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency. After being known to\\r\\noppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face of\\r\\nmy joining them _now_, when they are exceeding their first plan in every\\r\\nrespect; but I can think of no other alternative. Can you, Fanny?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny slowly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot immediately, but--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what? I see your judgment is not with me. Think it a little over.\\r\\nPerhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that _may_, of\\r\\nthe unpleasantness that _must_ arise from a young man's being received\\r\\nin this manner: domesticated among us; authorised to come at all hours,\\r\\nand placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints. To\\r\\nthink only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create. It\\r\\nis all very bad! Put yourself in Miss Crawford's place, Fanny. Consider\\r\\nwhat it would be to act Amelia with a stranger. She has a right to be\\r\\nfelt for, because she evidently feels for herself. I heard enough of\\r\\nwhat she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be\\r\\nacting with a stranger; and as she probably engaged in the part with\\r\\ndifferent expectations--perhaps without considering the subject enough\\r\\nto know what was likely to be--it would be ungenerous, it would be\\r\\nreally wrong to expose her to it. Her feelings ought to be respected.\\r\\nDoes it not strike you so, Fanny? You hesitate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in\\r\\nto do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think\\r\\nwill be disagreeable to my uncle. It will be such a triumph to the\\r\\nothers!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously I\\r\\nact. But, however, triumph there certainly will be, and I must brave it.\\r\\nBut if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business,\\r\\nof limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall be\\r\\nwell repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can do nothing: I have\\r\\noffended them, and they will not hear me; but when I have put them in\\r\\ngood-humour by this concession, I am not without hopes of persuading\\r\\nthem to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than\\r\\nthey are now in the high road for. This will be a material gain. My\\r\\nobject is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants. Will not this\\r\\nbe worth gaining?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, it will be a great point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut still it has not your approbation. Can you mention any other\\r\\nmeasure by which I have a chance of doing equal good?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I cannot think of anything else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGive me your approbation, then, Fanny. I am not comfortable without\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, cousin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you are against me, I ought to distrust myself, and yet--But it is\\r\\nabsolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way, riding about the\\r\\ncountry in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act--no matter whom:\\r\\nthe look of a gentleman is to be enough. I thought _you_ would have\\r\\nentered more into Miss Crawford's feelings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo doubt she will be very glad. It must be a great relief to her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nFanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last\\r\\nnight. It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe _was_ very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her spared\\xe2\\x80\\x9d...\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not finish the generous effusion. Her conscience stopt her in\\r\\nthe middle, but Edmund was satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall walk down immediately after breakfast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand am sure\\r\\nof giving pleasure there. And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you\\r\\nany longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I had\\r\\nspoken to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head has\\r\\nbeen full of this matter all night. It is an evil, but I am certainly\\r\\nmaking it less than it might be. If Tom is up, I shall go to him\\r\\ndirectly and get it over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all\\r\\nin high good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with\\r\\nsuch unanimity. _You_, in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip into\\r\\nChina, I suppose. How does Lord Macartney go on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--opening a volume on\\r\\nthe table and then taking up some others. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd here are Crabbe's Tales,\\r\\nand the Idler, at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book. I\\r\\nadmire your little establishment exceedingly; and as soon as I am\\r\\ngone, you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit\\r\\ncomfortably down to your table. But do not stay here to be cold.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure for Fanny. He\\r\\nhad told her the most extraordinary, the most inconceivable, the most\\r\\nunwelcome news; and she could think of nothing else. To be acting! After\\r\\nall his objections--objections so just and so public! After all that she\\r\\nhad heard him say, and seen him look, and known him to be feeling. Could\\r\\nit be possible? Edmund so inconsistent! Was he not deceiving himself?\\r\\nWas he not wrong? Alas! it was all Miss Crawford's doing. She had seen\\r\\nher influence in every speech, and was miserable. The doubts and alarms\\r\\nas to her own conduct, which had previously distressed her, and\\r\\nwhich had all slept while she listened to him, were become of little\\r\\nconsequence now. This deeper anxiety swallowed them up. Things should\\r\\ntake their course; she cared not how it ended. Her cousins might attack,\\r\\nbut could hardly tease her. She was beyond their reach; and if at last\\r\\nobliged to yield--no matter--it was all misery now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria. Such a\\r\\nvictory over Edmund's discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was\\r\\nmost delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in their\\r\\ndarling project, and they congratulated each other in private on the\\r\\njealous weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee\\r\\nof feelings gratified in every way. Edmund might still look grave, and\\r\\nsay he did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play\\r\\nin particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was driven\\r\\nto it by the force of selfish inclinations only. Edmund had descended\\r\\nfrom that moral elevation which he had maintained before, and they were\\r\\nboth as much the better as the happier for the descent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey behaved very well, however, to _him_ on the occasion, betraying no\\r\\nexultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemed\\r\\nto think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles\\r\\nMaddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him against their\\r\\ninclination. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo have it quite in their own family circle was what\\r\\nthey had particularly wished. A stranger among them would have been the\\r\\ndestruction of all their comfort\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea,\\r\\ngave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were\\r\\nready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It was\\r\\nall good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his\\r\\ndress, Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt's last scene with the Baron\\r\\nadmitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth undertook\\r\\nto count his speeches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny may be more disposed to oblige us now.\\r\\nPerhaps you may persuade _her_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, she is quite determined. She certainly will not act.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! very well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herself\\r\\nagain in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning to\\r\\nfail her already.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this\\r\\nchange in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered\\r\\nwith such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole\\r\\naffair as could have but one effect on him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was certainly right in\\r\\nrespecting such feelings; he was glad he had determined on it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And the\\r\\nmorning wore away in satisfactions very sweet, if not very sound. One\\r\\nadvantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss\\r\\nCrawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to\\r\\nundertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all\\r\\nthat occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day; and even this, when\\r\\nimparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss Crawford to\\r\\nwhom she was obliged--it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to\\r\\nexcite her gratitude, and whose merit in making them was spoken of\\r\\nwith a glow of admiration. She was safe; but peace and safety were\\r\\nunconnected here. Her mind had been never farther from peace. She could\\r\\nnot feel that she had done wrong herself, but she was disquieted\\r\\nin every other way. Her heart and her judgment were equally against\\r\\nEdmund's decision: she could not acquit his unsteadiness, and his\\r\\nhappiness under it made her wretched. She was full of jealousy and\\r\\nagitation. Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an\\r\\ninsult, with friendly expressions towards herself which she could hardly\\r\\nanswer calmly. Everybody around her was gay and busy, prosperous and\\r\\nimportant; each had their object of interest, their part, their dress,\\r\\ntheir favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all were finding\\r\\nemployment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in the playful\\r\\nconceits they suggested. She alone was sad and insignificant: she had\\r\\nno share in anything; she might go or stay; she might be in the midst\\r\\nof their noise, or retreat from it to the solitude of the East room,\\r\\nwithout being seen or missed. She could almost think anything would\\r\\nhave been preferable to this. Mrs. Grant was of consequence: _her_\\r\\ngood-nature had honourable mention; her taste and her time were\\r\\nconsidered; her presence was wanted; she was sought for, and attended,\\r\\nand praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the\\r\\ncharacter she had accepted. But reflection brought better feelings, and\\r\\nshewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect, which could never\\r\\nhave belonged to _her_; and that, had she received even the greatest,\\r\\nshe could never have been easy in joining a scheme which, considering\\r\\nonly her uncle, she must condemn altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them,\\r\\nas she soon began to acknowledge to herself. Julia was a sufferer too,\\r\\nthough not quite so blamelessly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Crawford had trifled with her feelings; but she had very long\\r\\nallowed and even sought his attentions, with a jealousy of her sister so\\r\\nreasonable as ought to have been their cure; and now that the conviction\\r\\nof his preference for Maria had been forced on her, she submitted to it\\r\\nwithout any alarm for Maria's situation, or any endeavour at rational\\r\\ntranquillity for herself. She either sat in gloomy silence, wrapt in\\r\\nsuch gravity as nothing could subdue, no curiosity touch, no wit amuse;\\r\\nor allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates, was talking with forced gaiety\\r\\nto him alone, and ridiculing the acting of the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford had\\r\\nendeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and\\r\\ncompliment, but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a\\r\\nfew repulses; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for\\r\\nmore than one flirtation, he grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather\\r\\nthought it a lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might\\r\\nere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant. She was not\\r\\npleased to see Julia excluded from the play, and sitting by disregarded;\\r\\nbut as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness, as Henry\\r\\nmust be the best judge of his own, and as he did assure her, with a\\r\\nmost persuasive smile, that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious\\r\\nthought of each other, she could only renew her former caution as to\\r\\nthe elder sister, entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too\\r\\nmuch admiration there, and then gladly take her share in anything that\\r\\nbrought cheerfulness to the young people in general, and that did so\\r\\nparticularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was her observation\\r\\nto Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say she is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Mary coldly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI imagine both sisters are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth! no, no, that must not be. Do not give him a hint of it. Think of\\r\\nMr. Rushworth!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth. It may\\r\\ndo _her_ some good. I often think of Mr. Rushworth's property and\\r\\nindependence, and wish them in other hands; but I never think of him. A\\r\\nman might represent the county with such an estate; a man might escape a\\r\\nprofession and represent the county.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say he _will_ be in parliament soon. When Sir Thomas comes, I\\r\\ndare say he will be in for some borough, but there has been nobody to\\r\\nput him in the way of doing anything yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nMary, after a pause. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you remember Hawkins Browne's 'Address to\\r\\nTobacco,' in imitation of Pope?--\\r\\n\\r\\n     Blest leaf! whose aromatic gales dispense\\r\\n     To Templars modesty, to Parsons sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will parody them--\\r\\n\\r\\n     Blest Knight! whose dictatorial looks dispense\\r\\n     To Children affluence, to Rushworth sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill not that do, Mrs. Grant? Everything seems to depend upon Sir\\r\\nThomas's return.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him\\r\\nin his family, I assure you. I do not think we do so well without him.\\r\\nHe has a fine dignified manner, which suits the head of such a house,\\r\\nand keeps everybody in their place. Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher\\r\\nnow than when he is at home; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in\\r\\norder. But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry. I\\r\\nam sure _Julia_ does not, or she would not have flirted as she did last\\r\\nnight with Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good friends, I\\r\\nthink she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would not give much for Mr. Rushworth's chance if Henry stept in\\r\\nbefore the articles were signed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as\\r\\nthe play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him know\\r\\nhis own mind; and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though he\\r\\nis Henry, for a time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJulia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned it not, and\\r\\nthough it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise. She had\\r\\nloved, she did love still, and she had all the suffering which a warm\\r\\ntemper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment\\r\\nof a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense of ill-usage.\\r\\nHer heart was sore and angry, and she was capable only of angry\\r\\nconsolations. The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was\\r\\nnow become her greatest enemy: they were alienated from each other;\\r\\nand Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the\\r\\nattentions which were still carrying on there, some punishment to\\r\\nMaria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr.\\r\\nRushworth. With no material fault of temper, or difference of opinion,\\r\\nto prevent their being very good friends while their interests were\\r\\nthe same, the sisters, under such a trial as this, had not affection or\\r\\nprinciple enough to make them merciful or just, to give them honour or\\r\\ncompassion. Maria felt her triumph, and pursued her purpose, careless of\\r\\nJulia; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawford\\r\\nwithout trusting that it would create jealousy, and bring a public\\r\\ndisturbance at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia; but there was no outward\\r\\nfellowship between them. Julia made no communication, and Fanny took\\r\\nno liberties. They were two solitary sufferers, or connected only by\\r\\nFanny's consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia's\\r\\ndiscomposure, and their blindness to its true cause, must be imputed to\\r\\nthe fullness of their own minds. They were totally preoccupied. Tom was\\r\\nengrossed by the concerns of his theatre, and saw nothing that did not\\r\\nimmediately relate to it. Edmund, between his theatrical and his real\\r\\npart, between Miss Crawford's claims and his own conduct, between love\\r\\nand consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy\\r\\nin contriving and directing the general little matters of the company,\\r\\nsuperintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for\\r\\nwhich nobody thanked her, and saving, with delighted integrity, half\\r\\na crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for\\r\\nwatching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and\\r\\ndresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great impediments\\r\\narose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was not all\\r\\nuninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she had not to\\r\\nwitness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost\\r\\ntoo much for her at first. Everybody began to have their vexation.\\r\\nEdmund had many. Entirely against _his_ judgment, a scene-painter\\r\\narrived from town, and was at work, much to the increase of the\\r\\nexpenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their proceedings; and\\r\\nhis brother, instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of\\r\\nthe representation, was giving an invitation to every family who came\\r\\nin his way. Tom himself began to fret over the scene-painter's slow\\r\\nprogress, and to feel the miseries of waiting. He had learned his\\r\\npart--all his parts, for he took every trifling one that could be united\\r\\nwith the Butler, and began to be impatient to be acting; and every day\\r\\nthus unemployed was tending to increase his sense of the insignificance\\r\\nof all his parts together, and make him more ready to regret that some\\r\\nother play had not been chosen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often the only\\r\\nlistener at hand, came in for the complaints and the distresses of\\r\\nmost of them. _She_ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant\\r\\ndreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; that\\r\\nTom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant\\r\\nspoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his\\r\\npart, and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth,\\r\\nwho was wanting a prompter through every speech. She knew, also, that\\r\\npoor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him: _his_\\r\\ncomplaint came before her as well as the rest; and so decided to her\\r\\neye was her cousin Maria's avoidance of him, and so needlessly often the\\r\\nrehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she had\\r\\nsoon all the terror of other complaints from _him_. So far from being\\r\\nall satisfied and all enjoying, she found everybody requiring something\\r\\nthey had not, and giving occasion of discontent to the others. Everybody\\r\\nhad a part either too long or too short; nobody would attend as they\\r\\nought; nobody would remember on which side they were to come in; nobody\\r\\nbut the complainer would observe any directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the\\r\\nplay as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure to\\r\\n_her_ to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the first\\r\\nact, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria.\\r\\nMaria, she also thought, acted well, too well; and after the first\\r\\nrehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience; and sometimes\\r\\nas prompter, sometimes as spectator, was often very useful. As far as\\r\\nshe could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all: he\\r\\nhad more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom, more talent and\\r\\ntaste than Mr. Yates. She did not like him as a man, but she must admit\\r\\nhim to be the best actor, and on this point there were not many who\\r\\ndiffered from her. Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed against his tameness and\\r\\ninsipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr. Rushworth turned to her\\r\\nwith a black look, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think there is anything so very\\r\\nfine in all this? For the life and soul of me, I cannot admire him; and,\\r\\nbetween ourselves, to see such an undersized, little, mean-looking man,\\r\\nset up for a fine actor, is very ridiculous in my opinion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this moment there was a return of his former jealousy, which Maria,\\r\\nfrom increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to remove; and\\r\\nthe chances of Mr. Rushworth's ever attaining to the knowledge of his\\r\\ntwo-and-forty speeches became much less. As to his ever making anything\\r\\n_tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that except\\r\\nhis mother; _she_, indeed, regretted that his part was not more\\r\\nconsiderable, and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they were\\r\\nforward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes; but the\\r\\nothers aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword, and the\\r\\nfirst line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter through\\r\\nthe rest. Fanny, in her pity and kindheartedness, was at great pains to\\r\\nteach him how to learn, giving him all the helps and directions in her\\r\\npower, trying to make an artificial memory for him, and learning every\\r\\nword of his part herself, but without his being much the forwarder.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she certainly had;\\r\\nbut with all these, and other claims on her time and attention, she was\\r\\nas far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them,\\r\\nas without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from having no\\r\\ndemand on her leisure as on her compassion. The gloom of her first\\r\\nanticipations was proved to have been unfounded. She was occasionally\\r\\nuseful to all; she was perhaps as much at peace as any.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover, in which her\\r\\nhelp was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well off\\r\\nas the rest, was evident by the manner in which she claimed it--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome,\\r\\nFanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthese are fine times for you, but you must not be\\r\\nalways walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on at\\r\\nyour ease, in this way; I want you here. I have been slaving myself till\\r\\nI can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth's cloak without sending\\r\\nfor any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help in putting\\r\\nit together. There are but three seams; you may do them in a trice. It\\r\\nwould be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do.\\r\\n_You_ are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than _you_,\\r\\nwe should not get on very fast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny took the work very quietly, without attempting any defence; but\\r\\nher kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted: it is\\r\\nall new to her, you know; you and I used to be very fond of a play\\r\\nourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at\\r\\nleisure, _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too. What is the play\\r\\nabout, Fanny? you have never told me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not one of those who\\r\\ncan talk and work at the same time. It is about Lovers' Vows.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere will be three acts\\r\\nrehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of\\r\\nseeing all the actors at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better stay till the curtain is hung,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interposed Mrs. Norris;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe curtain will be hung in a day or two--there is very little sense in\\r\\na play without a curtain--and I am much mistaken if you do not find it\\r\\ndraw up into very handsome festoons.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting. Fanny did not share her\\r\\naunt's composure: she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the\\r\\nthree acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting\\r\\ntogether for the first time; the third act would bring a scene between\\r\\nthem which interested her most particularly, and which she was longing\\r\\nand dreading to see how they would perform. The whole subject of it was\\r\\nlove--a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman, and very\\r\\nlittle short of a declaration of love be made by the lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had read and read the scene again with many painful, many wondering\\r\\nemotions, and looked forward to their representation of it as a\\r\\ncircumstance almost too interesting. She did not _believe_ they had yet\\r\\nrehearsed it, even in private.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morrow came, the plan for the evening continued, and Fanny's\\r\\nconsideration of it did not become less agitated. She worked very\\r\\ndiligently under her aunt's directions, but her diligence and her\\r\\nsilence concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon she\\r\\nmade her escape with her work to the East room, that she might have no\\r\\nconcern in another, and, as she deemed it, most unnecessary rehearsal of\\r\\nthe first act, which Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous at\\r\\nonce of having her time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr.\\r\\nRushworth. A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladies\\r\\nwalking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat, and\\r\\nshe worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a quarter of\\r\\nan hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of\\r\\nMiss Crawford.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I right? Yes; this is the East room. My dear Miss Price, I beg your\\r\\npardon, but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the room\\r\\nby her civilities, and looked at the bright bars of her empty grate with\\r\\nconcern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you; I am quite warm, very warm. Allow me to stay here a little\\r\\nwhile, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act. I have brought\\r\\nmy book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be _so_\\r\\nobliged! I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund--by\\r\\nourselves--against the evening, but he is not in the way; and if he\\r\\n_were_, I do not think I could go through it with _him_, till I have\\r\\nhardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two. You will\\r\\nbe so good, won't you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was most civil in her assurances, though she could not give them\\r\\nin a very steady voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you ever happened to look at the part I mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Miss\\r\\nCrawford, opening her book. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere it is. I did not think much of it at\\r\\nfirst--but, upon my word. There, look at _that_ speech, and _that_, and\\r\\n_that_. How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things? Could\\r\\nyou do it? But then he is your cousin, which makes all the difference.\\r\\nYou must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy _you_ him, and get on by\\r\\ndegrees. You _have_ a look of _his_ sometimes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave I? I will do my best with the greatest readiness; but I must\\r\\n_read_ the part, for I can say very little of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_None_ of it, I suppose. You are to have the book, of course. Now for\\r\\nit. We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the\\r\\nfront of the stage. There--very good school-room chairs, not made for a\\r\\ntheatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick\\r\\ntheir feet against when they are learning a lesson. What would your\\r\\ngoverness and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose? Could\\r\\nSir Thomas look in upon us just now, he would bless himself, for we\\r\\nare rehearsing all over the house. Yates is storming away in the\\r\\ndining-room. I heard him as I came upstairs, and the theatre is engaged\\r\\nof course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick. If\\r\\n_they_ are not perfect, I _shall_ be surprised. By the bye, I looked in\\r\\nupon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the\\r\\ntimes when they were trying _not_ to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was with\\r\\nme. I thought he began to look a little queer, so I turned it off as\\r\\nwell as I could, by whispering to him, 'We shall have an excellent\\r\\nAgatha; there is something so _maternal_ in her manner, so completely\\r\\n_maternal_ in her voice and countenance.' Was not that well done of me?\\r\\nHe brightened up directly. Now for my soliloquy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the\\r\\nidea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire; but\\r\\nwith looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of\\r\\na man. With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;\\r\\nand they had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought\\r\\na pause, and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the three\\r\\non this unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the very same\\r\\nbusiness that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure were\\r\\nlikely to be more than momentary in _them_. He too had his book, and was\\r\\nseeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him, and help him to prepare\\r\\nfor the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house;\\r\\nand great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together, of\\r\\ncomparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny's kind offices.\\r\\n\\r\\n_She_ could not equal them in their warmth. _Her_ spirits sank under the\\r\\nglow of theirs, and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to\\r\\nboth to have any comfort in having been sought by either. They must now\\r\\nrehearse together. Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,\\r\\nnot very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was\\r\\nwanted only to prompt and observe them. She was invested, indeed, with\\r\\nthe office of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it and\\r\\ntell them all their faults; but from doing so every feeling within her\\r\\nshrank--she could not, would not, dared not attempt it: had she been\\r\\notherwise qualified for criticism, her conscience must have restrained\\r\\nher from venturing at disapprobation. She believed herself to feel too\\r\\nmuch of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars. To\\r\\nprompt them must be enough for her; and it was sometimes _more_ than\\r\\nenough; for she could not always pay attention to the book. In watching\\r\\nthem she forgot herself; and, agitated by the increasing spirit of\\r\\nEdmund's manner, had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he\\r\\nwanted help. It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she was\\r\\nthanked and pitied; but she deserved their pity more than she hoped they\\r\\nwould ever surmise. At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced herself\\r\\nto add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other; and when\\r\\nagain alone and able to recall the whole, she was inclined to believe\\r\\ntheir performance would, indeed, have such nature and feeling in it as\\r\\nmust ensure their credit, and make it a very suffering exhibition to\\r\\nherself. Whatever might be its effect, however, she must stand the brunt\\r\\nof it again that very day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly to\\r\\ntake place in the evening: Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to\\r\\nreturn for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner; and every\\r\\none concerned was looking forward with eagerness. There seemed a general\\r\\ndiffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion. Tom was enjoying such an\\r\\nadvance towards the end; Edmund was in spirits from the morning's\\r\\nrehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away. All\\r\\nwere alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the gentlemen soon\\r\\nfollowed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and\\r\\nJulia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour; and having lighted\\r\\nit up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only the\\r\\narrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there was no Mrs. Grant.\\r\\nShe could not come. Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which he\\r\\nhad little credit with his fair sister-in-law, could not spare his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDr. Grant is ill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, with mock solemnity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has been ill ever\\r\\nsince he did not eat any of the pheasant today. He fancied it tough,\\r\\nsent away his plate, and has been suffering ever since\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was disappointment! Mrs. Grant's non-attendance was sad indeed.\\r\\nHer pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her always valuable\\r\\namongst them; but _now_ she was absolutely necessary. They could not\\r\\nact, they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her. The\\r\\ncomfort of the whole evening was destroyed. What was to be done? Tom, as\\r\\nCottager, was in despair. After a pause of perplexity, some eyes began\\r\\nto be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Miss Price\\r\\nwould be so good as to _read_ the part.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She was immediately surrounded\\r\\nby supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo, Fanny, if\\r\\nit is not _very_ disagreeable to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fanny still hung back. She could not endure the idea of it. Why was\\r\\nnot Miss Crawford to be applied to as well? Or why had not she rather\\r\\ngone to her own room, as she had felt to be safest, instead of attending\\r\\nthe rehearsal at all? She had known it would irritate and distress her;\\r\\nshe had known it her duty to keep away. She was properly punished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have only to _read_ the part,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Henry Crawford, with renewed\\r\\nentreaty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I do believe she can say every word of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Maria, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor she\\r\\ncould put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places. Fanny, I am\\r\\nsure you know the part.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny could not say she did _not_; and as they all persevered, as\\r\\nEdmund repeated his wish, and with a look of even fond dependence on\\r\\nher good-nature, she must yield. She would do her best. Everybody was\\r\\nsatisfied; and she was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart,\\r\\nwhile the others prepared to begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey _did_ begin; and being too much engaged in their own noise to be\\r\\nstruck by an unusual noise in the other part of the house, had proceeded\\r\\nsome way when the door of the room was thrown open, and Julia, appearing\\r\\nat it, with a face all aghast, exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy father is come! He is in\\r\\nthe hall at this moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\nHow is the consternation of the party to be described? To the greater\\r\\nnumber it was a moment of absolute horror. Sir Thomas in the house! All\\r\\nfelt the instantaneous conviction. Not a hope of imposition or mistake\\r\\nwas harboured anywhere. Julia's looks were an evidence of the fact that\\r\\nmade it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations, not a\\r\\nword was spoken for half a minute: each with an altered countenance was\\r\\nlooking at some other, and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most\\r\\nunwelcome, most ill-timed, most appalling! Mr. Yates might consider\\r\\nit only as a vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr. Rushworth\\r\\nmight imagine it a blessing; but every other heart was sinking under\\r\\nsome degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm, every other heart\\r\\nwas suggesting, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat will become of us? what is to be done now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\r\\nwas a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were the corroborating\\r\\nsounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulia was the first to move and speak again. Jealousy and bitterness\\r\\nhad been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause; but at the\\r\\nmoment of her appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of devotion\\r\\nto Agatha's narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart; and as soon\\r\\nas she could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock of her\\r\\nwords, he still kept his station and retained her sister's hand, her\\r\\nwounded heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red as she had\\r\\nbeen white before, she turned out of the room, saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_I_ need not be\\r\\nafraid of appearing before him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer going roused the rest; and at the same moment the two brothers\\r\\nstepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something. A very few\\r\\nwords between them were sufficient. The case admitted no difference of\\r\\nopinion: they must go to the drawing-room directly. Maria joined them\\r\\nwith the same intent, just then the stoutest of the three; for the\\r\\nvery circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest\\r\\nsupport. Henry Crawford's retaining her hand at such a moment, a moment\\r\\nof such peculiar proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt and\\r\\nanxiety. She hailed it as an earnest of the most serious determination,\\r\\nand was equal even to encounter her father. They walked off, utterly\\r\\nheedless of Mr. Rushworth's repeated question of, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall I go too? Had\\r\\nnot I better go too? Will not it be right for me to go too?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but they\\r\\nwere no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer\\r\\nthe anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him by all means to pay his\\r\\nrespects to Sir Thomas without delay, sent him after the others with\\r\\ndelighted haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates. She had been quite\\r\\noverlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of her claims on Sir\\r\\nThomas's affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing\\r\\nherself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and gain a\\r\\nlittle breathing-time. Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that was\\r\\nendured by the rest, by the right of a disposition which not even\\r\\ninnocence could keep from suffering. She was nearly fainting: all her\\r\\nformer habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it compassion\\r\\nfor him and for almost every one of the party on the development before\\r\\nhim, with solicitude on Edmund's account indescribable. She had found\\r\\na seat, where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful\\r\\nthoughts, while the other three, no longer under any restraint, were\\r\\ngiving vent to their feelings of vexation, lamenting over such an\\r\\nunlooked-for premature arrival as a most untoward event, and without\\r\\nmercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage, or\\r\\nwere still in Antigua.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates, from better\\r\\nunderstanding the family, and judging more clearly of the mischief that\\r\\nmust ensue. The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt\\r\\nthe total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr.\\r\\nYates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for the\\r\\nevening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being\\r\\nrenewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over,\\r\\nand he might be at leisure to be amused by it. The Crawfords laughed\\r\\nat the idea; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walking\\r\\nquietly home and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr. Yates's\\r\\naccompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage. But Mr.\\r\\nYates, having never been with those who thought much of parental claims,\\r\\nor family confidence, could not perceive that anything of the kind was\\r\\nnecessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che preferred remaining\\r\\nwhere he was, that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman\\r\\nhandsomely since he _was_ come; and besides, he did not think it would\\r\\nbe fair by the others to have everybody run away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was just beginning to collect herself, and to feel that if she\\r\\nstaid longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when this point was\\r\\nsettled, and being commissioned with the brother and sister's apology,\\r\\nsaw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the\\r\\ndreadful duty of appearing before her uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo soon did she find herself at the drawing-room door; and after\\r\\npausing a moment for what she knew would not come, for a courage which\\r\\nthe outside of no door had ever supplied to her, she turned the lock in\\r\\ndesperation, and the lights of the drawing-room, and all the collected\\r\\nfamily, were before her. As she entered, her own name caught her ear.\\r\\nSir Thomas was at that moment looking round him, and saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut where\\r\\nis Fanny? Why do not I see my little Fanny?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--and on perceiving her,\\r\\ncame forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her,\\r\\ncalling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately, and observing\\r\\nwith decided pleasure how much she was grown! Fanny knew not how to\\r\\nfeel, nor where to look. She was quite oppressed. He had never been so\\r\\nkind, so _very_ kind to her in his life. His manner seemed changed, his\\r\\nvoice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that had been awful\\r\\nin his dignity seemed lost in tenderness. He led her nearer the light\\r\\nand looked at her again--inquired particularly after her health, and\\r\\nthen, correcting himself, observed that he need not inquire, for\\r\\nher appearance spoke sufficiently on that point. A fine blush having\\r\\nsucceeded the previous paleness of her face, he was justified in his\\r\\nbelief of her equal improvement in health and beauty. He inquired next\\r\\nafter her family, especially William: and his kindness altogether was\\r\\nsuch as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and thinking\\r\\nhis return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift her eyes to\\r\\nhis face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the burnt, fagged,\\r\\nworn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender feeling was\\r\\nincreased, and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected\\r\\nvexation was probably ready to burst on him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at his suggestion\\r\\nnow seated themselves round the fire. He had the best right to be the\\r\\ntalker; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own\\r\\nhouse, in the centre of his family, after such a separation, made him\\r\\ncommunicative and chatty in a very unusual degree; and he was ready to\\r\\ngive every information as to his voyage, and answer every question\\r\\nof his two sons almost before it was put. His business in Antigua had\\r\\nlatterly been prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool,\\r\\nhaving had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private\\r\\nvessel, instead of waiting for the packet; and all the little\\r\\nparticulars of his proceedings and events, his arrivals and departures,\\r\\nwere most promptly delivered, as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with\\r\\nheartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him--interrupting himself\\r\\nmore than once, however, to remark on his good fortune in finding them\\r\\nall at home--coming unexpectedly as he did--all collected together\\r\\nexactly as he could have wished, but dared not depend on. Mr. Rushworth\\r\\nwas not forgotten: a most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shaking\\r\\nhad already met him, and with pointed attention he was now included in\\r\\nthe objects most intimately connected with Mansfield. There was nothing\\r\\ndisagreeable in Mr. Rushworth's appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking\\r\\nhim already.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken,\\r\\nunalloyed enjoyment as by his wife, who was really extremely happy to\\r\\nsee him, and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to\\r\\nplace her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years.\\r\\nShe had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained so\\r\\nsensibly animated as to put away her work, move Pug from her side, and\\r\\ngive all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband. She\\r\\nhad no anxieties for anybody to cloud _her_ pleasure: her own time had\\r\\nbeen irreproachably spent during his absence: she had done a great\\r\\ndeal of carpet-work, and made many yards of fringe; and she would have\\r\\nanswered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all\\r\\nthe young people as for her own. It was so agreeable to her to see\\r\\nhim again, and hear him talk, to have her ear amused and her whole\\r\\ncomprehension filled by his narratives, that she began particularly\\r\\nto feel how dreadfully she must have missed him, and how impossible it\\r\\nwould have been for her to bear a lengthened absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her\\r\\nsister. Not that _she_ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas's\\r\\ndisapprobation when the present state of his house should be known, for\\r\\nher judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive caution\\r\\nwith which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth's pink satin cloak as her\\r\\nbrother-in-law entered, she could hardly be said to shew any sign of\\r\\nalarm; but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return. It had left her\\r\\nnothing to do. Instead of being sent for out of the room, and seeing\\r\\nhim first, and having to spread the happy news through the house, Sir\\r\\nThomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the nerves of his\\r\\nwife and children, had sought no confidant but the butler, and had been\\r\\nfollowing him almost instantaneously into the drawing-room. Mrs. Norris\\r\\nfelt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended,\\r\\nwhether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded; and was\\r\\nnow trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about,\\r\\nand labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity\\r\\nand silence. Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat, she might have gone\\r\\nto the housekeeper with troublesome directions, and insulted the footmen\\r\\nwith injunctions of despatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all\\r\\ndinner: he would take nothing, nothing till tea came--he would rather\\r\\nwait for tea. Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something\\r\\ndifferent; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England,\\r\\nwhen the alarm of a French privateer was at the height, she burst\\r\\nthrough his recital with the proposal of soup. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSure, my dear Sir\\r\\nThomas, a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea.\\r\\nDo have a basin of soup.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas could not be provoked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStill the same anxiety for\\r\\neverybody's comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his answer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut indeed I\\r\\nwould rather have nothing but tea.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose\\r\\nyou hurry Baddeley a little; he seems behindhand to-night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She carried\\r\\nthis point, and Sir Thomas's narrative proceeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length there was a pause. His immediate communications were\\r\\nexhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him, now\\r\\nat one, now at another of the beloved circle; but the pause was not\\r\\nlong: in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and\\r\\nwhat were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow\\r\\ndo you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, Sir\\r\\nThomas? They have been acting. We have been all alive with acting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed! and what have you been acting?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! they'll tell you all about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe _all_ will soon be told,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Tom hastily, and with affected\\r\\nunconcern; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it is not worth while to bore my father with it now. You\\r\\nwill hear enough of it to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by way\\r\\nof doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last week,\\r\\nto get up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We have had such incessant rains\\r\\nalmost since October began, that we have been nearly confined to the\\r\\nhouse for days together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd.\\r\\nTolerable sport the first three days, but there has been no attempting\\r\\nanything since. The first day I went over Mansfield Wood, and Edmund\\r\\ntook the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace between\\r\\nus, and might each have killed six times as many, but we respect your\\r\\npheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire. I do not\\r\\nthink you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they\\r\\nwere. _I_ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life\\r\\nas this year. I hope you will take a day's sport there yourself, sir,\\r\\nsoon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the present the danger was over, and Fanny's sick feelings subsided;\\r\\nbut when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas, getting up,\\r\\nsaid that he found that he could not be any longer in the house without\\r\\njust looking into his own dear room, every agitation was returning. He\\r\\nwas gone before anything had been said to prepare him for the change he\\r\\nmust find there; and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance. Edmund\\r\\nwas the first to speak--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething must be done,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is time to think of our visitors,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Maria, still feeling her\\r\\nhand pressed to Henry Crawford's heart, and caring little for anything\\r\\nelse. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen poor Yates is all alone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Tom. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will go and fetch him. He\\r\\nwill be no bad assistant when it all comes out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the theatre he went, and reached it just in time to witness the first\\r\\nmeeting of his father and his friend. Sir Thomas had been a good deal\\r\\nsurprised to find candles burning in his room; and on casting his eye\\r\\nround it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air\\r\\nof confusion in the furniture. The removal of the bookcase from before\\r\\nthe billiard-room door struck him especially, but he had scarcely more\\r\\nthan time to feel astonished at all this, before there were sounds from\\r\\nthe billiard-room to astonish him still farther. Some one was talking\\r\\nthere in a very loud accent; he did not know the voice--more than\\r\\ntalking--almost hallooing. He stepped to the door, rejoicing at that\\r\\nmoment in having the means of immediate communication, and, opening it,\\r\\nfound himself on the stage of a theatre, and opposed to a ranting young\\r\\nman, who appeared likely to knock him down backwards. At the very moment\\r\\nof Yates perceiving Sir Thomas, and giving perhaps the very best start\\r\\nhe had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals, Tom Bertram\\r\\nentered at the other end of the room; and never had he found greater\\r\\ndifficulty in keeping his countenance. His father's looks of solemnity\\r\\nand amazement on this his first appearance on any stage, and the gradual\\r\\nmetamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and\\r\\neasy Mr. Yates, making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was\\r\\nsuch an exhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he would not have\\r\\nlost upon any account. It would be the last--in all probability--the\\r\\nlast scene on that stage; but he was sure there could not be a finer.\\r\\nThe house would close with the greatest eclat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was little time, however, for the indulgence of any images of\\r\\nmerriment. It was necessary for him to step forward, too, and assist\\r\\nthe introduction, and with many awkward sensations he did his best. Sir\\r\\nThomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which\\r\\nwas due to his own character, but was really as far from pleased\\r\\nwith the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its\\r\\ncommencement. Mr. Yates's family and connexions were sufficiently known\\r\\nto him to render his introduction as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparticular friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d another of\\r\\nthe hundred particular friends of his son, exceedingly unwelcome; and it\\r\\nneeded all the felicity of being again at home, and all the forbearance\\r\\nit could supply, to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus\\r\\nbewildered in his own house, making part of a ridiculous exhibition in\\r\\nthe midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced in so untoward a moment to\\r\\nadmit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving,\\r\\nand whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first\\r\\nfive minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom understood his father's thoughts, and heartily wishing he might be\\r\\nalways as well disposed to give them but partial expression, began to\\r\\nsee, more clearly than he had ever done before, that there might be some\\r\\nground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance his\\r\\nfather gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that when he\\r\\ninquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard-table, he was\\r\\nnot proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity. A few minutes were\\r\\nenough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side; and Sir\\r\\nThomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of\\r\\ncalm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates, as to the\\r\\nhappiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen returned to the\\r\\ndrawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was\\r\\nnot lost on all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI come from your theatre,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he composedly, as he sat down; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI found\\r\\nmyself in it rather unexpectedly. Its vicinity to my own room--but in\\r\\nevery respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the smallest\\r\\nsuspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character. It\\r\\nappears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by candlelight,\\r\\nand does my friend Christopher Jackson credit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And then he would\\r\\nhave changed the subject, and sipped his coffee in peace over domestic\\r\\nmatters of a calmer hue; but Mr. Yates, without discernment to catch Sir\\r\\nThomas's meaning, or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion enough to\\r\\nallow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others with\\r\\nthe least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him on the topic of the\\r\\ntheatre, would torment him with questions and remarks relative to it,\\r\\nand finally would make him hear the whole history of his disappointment\\r\\nat Ecclesford. Sir Thomas listened most politely, but found much to\\r\\noffend his ideas of decorum, and confirm his ill-opinion of Mr. Yates's\\r\\nhabits of thinking, from the beginning to the end of the story; and when\\r\\nit was over, could give him no other assurance of sympathy than what a\\r\\nslight bow conveyed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was, in fact, the origin of _our_ acting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom, after\\r\\na moment's thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy friend Yates brought the infection from\\r\\nEcclesford, and it spread--as those things always spread, you know,\\r\\nsir--the faster, probably, from _your_ having so often encouraged the\\r\\nsort of thing in us formerly. It was like treading old ground again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible, and\\r\\nimmediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were\\r\\ndoing: told him of the gradual increase of their views, the happy\\r\\nconclusion of their first difficulties, and present promising state of\\r\\naffairs; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him not\\r\\nonly totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his\\r\\nfriends as they sat, the change of countenance, the fidget, the hem! of\\r\\nunquietness, but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the\\r\\nface on which his own eyes were fixed--from seeing Sir Thomas's dark\\r\\nbrow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters\\r\\nand Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter, and speaking a\\r\\nlanguage, a remonstrance, a reproof, which _he_ felt at his heart. Not\\r\\nless acutely was it felt by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behind\\r\\nher aunt's end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself, saw all\\r\\nthat was passing before her. Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his\\r\\nfather she could never have expected to witness; and to feel that it\\r\\nwas in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed. Sir Thomas's\\r\\nlook implied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn your judgment, Edmund, I depended; what have you\\r\\nbeen about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She knelt in spirit to her uncle, and her bosom swelled to\\r\\nutter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, not to _him_! Look so to all the others, but not to _him_!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Yates was still talking. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo own the truth, Sir Thomas, we were in\\r\\nthe middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening. We were going\\r\\nthrough the three first acts, and not unsuccessfully upon the whole. Our\\r\\ncompany is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home, that\\r\\nnothing more can be done to-night; but if you will give us the honour of\\r\\nyour company to-morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the result. We\\r\\nbespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young performers; we bespeak\\r\\nyour indulgence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy indulgence shall be given, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Sir Thomas gravely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\nwithout any other rehearsal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And with a relenting smile, he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ncome home to be happy and indulgent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then turning away towards any\\r\\nor all of the rest, he tranquilly said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. and Miss Crawford were\\r\\nmentioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeable\\r\\nacquaintance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he being entirely\\r\\nwithout particular regard for either, without jealousy either in love\\r\\nor acting, could speak very handsomely of both. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Crawford was a\\r\\nmost pleasant, gentleman-like man; his sister a sweet, pretty, elegant,\\r\\nlively girl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Rushworth could be silent no longer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not say he is not\\r\\ngentleman-like, considering; but you should tell your father he is not\\r\\nabove five feet eight, or he will be expecting a well-looking man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas did not quite understand this, and looked with some surprise\\r\\nat the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I must say what I think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mr. Rushworth, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin my opinion it\\r\\nis very disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much of a\\r\\ngood thing. I am not so fond of acting as I was at first. I think we are\\r\\na great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves,\\r\\nand doing nothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas looked again, and then replied with an approving smile, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\nhappy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same. It gives\\r\\nme sincere satisfaction. That I should be cautious and quick-sighted,\\r\\nand feel many scruples which my children do _not_ feel, is perfectly\\r\\nnatural; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity, for a\\r\\nhome which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much exceed theirs. But at\\r\\nyour time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable circumstance\\r\\nfor yourself, and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible of\\r\\nthe importance of having an ally of such weight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth's opinion in better words\\r\\nthan he could find himself. He was aware that he must not expect a\\r\\ngenius in Mr. Rushworth; but as a well-judging, steady young man, with\\r\\nbetter notions than his elocution would do justice to, he intended to\\r\\nvalue him very highly. It was impossible for many of the others not to\\r\\nsmile. Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning; but by\\r\\nlooking, as he really felt, most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas's\\r\\ngood opinion, and saying scarcely anything, he did his best towards\\r\\npreserving that good opinion a little longer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund's first object the next morning was to see his father alone, and\\r\\ngive him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme, defending his own\\r\\nshare in it as far only as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel his\\r\\nmotives to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, that\\r\\nhis concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his\\r\\njudgment in it very doubtful. He was anxious, while vindicating himself,\\r\\nto say nothing unkind of the others: but there was only one amongst\\r\\nthem whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defence\\r\\nor palliation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have all been more or less to blame,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cevery\\r\\none of us, excepting Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly\\r\\nthroughout; who has been consistent. _Her_ feelings have been steadily\\r\\nagainst it from first to last. She never ceased to think of what was due\\r\\nto you. You will find Fanny everything you could wish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party,\\r\\nand at such a time, as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must; he\\r\\nfelt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands with\\r\\nEdmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and forget how\\r\\nmuch he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could, after the house\\r\\nhad been cleared of every object enforcing the remembrance, and restored\\r\\nto its proper state. He did not enter into any remonstrance with his\\r\\nother children: he was more willing to believe they felt their error\\r\\nthan to run the risk of investigation. The reproof of an immediate\\r\\nconclusion of everything, the sweep of every preparation, would be\\r\\nsufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one person, however, in the house, whom he could not leave\\r\\nto learn his sentiments merely through his conduct. He could not help\\r\\ngiving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having hoped that her advice might\\r\\nhave been interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly have\\r\\ndisapproved. The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming the\\r\\nplan; they ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves;\\r\\nbut they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of unsteady\\r\\ncharacters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he must regard her\\r\\nacquiescence in their wrong measures, her countenance of their unsafe\\r\\namusements, than that such measures and such amusements should have\\r\\nbeen suggested. Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly\\r\\nbeing silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she was ashamed to\\r\\nconfess having never seen any of the impropriety which was so glaring\\r\\nto Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her influence was\\r\\ninsufficient--that she might have talked in vain. Her only resource was\\r\\nto get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn the current\\r\\nof Sir Thomas's ideas into a happier channel. She had a great deal to\\r\\ninsinuate in her own praise as to _general_ attention to the interest\\r\\nand comfort of his family, much exertion and many sacrifices to glance\\r\\nat in the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from her own\\r\\nfireside, and many excellent hints of distrust and economy to Lady\\r\\nBertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most considerable saving had\\r\\nalways arisen, and more than one bad servant been detected. But her\\r\\nchief strength lay in Sotherton. Her greatest support and glory was\\r\\nin having formed the connexion with the Rushworths. _There_ she\\r\\nwas impregnable. She took to herself all the credit of bringing Mr.\\r\\nRushworth's admiration of Maria to any effect. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I had not been\\r\\nactive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand made a point of being introduced to his mother,\\r\\nand then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit, I am as certain\\r\\nas I sit here that nothing would have come of it; for Mr. Rushworth\\r\\nis the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of\\r\\nencouragement, and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we\\r\\nhad been idle. But I left no stone unturned. I was ready to move heaven\\r\\nand earth to persuade my sister, and at last I did persuade her. You\\r\\nknow the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle of winter, and the\\r\\nroads almost impassable, but I did persuade her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know how great, how justly great, your influence is with Lady Bertram\\r\\nand her children, and am the more concerned that it should not have\\r\\nbeen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads _that_ day!\\r\\nI thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four\\r\\nhorses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his\\r\\ngreat love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box on\\r\\naccount of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since\\r\\nMichaelmas. I cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter--and\\r\\nthis was such a day, I could not help going to him up in his room before\\r\\nwe set off to advise him not to venture: he was putting on his wig; so\\r\\nI said, 'Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I shall be\\r\\nvery safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has been upon the\\r\\nleaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.' But, however, I\\r\\nsoon found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and as I hate to be\\r\\nworrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart quite ached for him\\r\\nat every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke, where,\\r\\nwhat with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it was worse than anything\\r\\nyou can imagine, I was quite in an agony about him. And then the poor\\r\\nhorses too! To see them straining away! You know how I always feel for\\r\\nthe horses. And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do you\\r\\nthink I did? You will laugh at me; but I got out and walked up. I did\\r\\nindeed. It might not be saving them much, but it was something, and I\\r\\ncould not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of\\r\\nthose noble animals. I caught a dreadful cold, but _that_ I did not\\r\\nregard. My object was accomplished in the visit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that\\r\\nmight be taken to establish it. There is nothing very striking in Mr.\\r\\nRushworth's manners, but I was pleased last night with what appeared to\\r\\nbe his opinion on one subject: his decided preference of a quiet family\\r\\nparty to the bustle and confusion of acting. He seemed to feel exactly\\r\\nas one could wish.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, and the more you know of him the better you will like him.\\r\\nHe is not a shining character, but he has a thousand good qualities; and\\r\\nis so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about it,\\r\\nfor everybody considers it as my doing. 'Upon my word, Mrs. Norris,'\\r\\nsaid Mrs. Grant the other day, 'if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own,\\r\\nhe could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions, disarmed by her\\r\\nflattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that\\r\\nwhere the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her kindness\\r\\ndid sometimes overpower her judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a busy morning with him. Conversation with any of them occupied\\r\\nbut a small part of it. He had to reinstate himself in all the wonted\\r\\nconcerns of his Mansfield life: to see his steward and his bailiff; to\\r\\nexamine and compute, and, in the intervals of business, to walk into\\r\\nhis stables and his gardens, and nearest plantations; but active and\\r\\nmethodical, he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat as\\r\\nmaster of the house at dinner, he had also set the carpenter to work in\\r\\npulling down what had been so lately put up in the billiard-room,\\r\\nand given the scene-painter his dismissal long enough to justify the\\r\\npleasing belief of his being then at least as far off as Northampton.\\r\\nThe scene-painter was gone, having spoilt only the floor of one room,\\r\\nruined all the coachman's sponges, and made five of the under-servants\\r\\nidle and dissatisfied; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or\\r\\ntwo would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been,\\r\\neven to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers' Vows in the\\r\\nhouse, for he was burning all that met his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas's intentions,\\r\\nthough as far as ever from understanding their source. He and his friend\\r\\nhad been out with their guns the chief of the morning, and Tom had taken\\r\\nthe opportunity of explaining, with proper apologies for his father's\\r\\nparticularity, what was to be expected. Mr. Yates felt it as acutely as\\r\\nmight be supposed. To be a second time disappointed in the same way was\\r\\nan instance of very severe ill-luck; and his indignation was such,\\r\\nthat had it not been for delicacy towards his friend, and his friend's\\r\\nyoungest sister, he believed he should certainly attack the baronet\\r\\non the absurdity of his proceedings, and argue him into a little more\\r\\nrationality. He believed this very stoutly while he was in Mansfield\\r\\nWood, and all the way home; but there was a something in Sir Thomas,\\r\\nwhen they sat round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think it\\r\\nwiser to let him pursue his own way, and feel the folly of it without\\r\\nopposition. He had known many disagreeable fathers before, and often\\r\\nbeen struck with the inconveniences they occasioned, but never, in\\r\\nthe whole course of his life, had he seen one of that class so\\r\\nunintelligibly moral, so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas. He was\\r\\nnot a man to be endured but for his children's sake, and he might be\\r\\nthankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay\\r\\na few days longer under his roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every\\r\\nmind was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his\\r\\ndaughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony. Maria was in a\\r\\ngood deal of agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her that\\r\\nCrawford should now lose no time in declaring himself, and she was\\r\\ndisturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance\\r\\nthat point. She had been expecting to see him the whole morning, and\\r\\nall the evening, too, was still expecting him. Mr. Rushworth had set off\\r\\nearly with the great news for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped for\\r\\nsuch an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him the trouble of\\r\\never coming back again. But they had seen no one from the Parsonage,\\r\\nnot a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of\\r\\ncongratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram. It was the\\r\\nfirst day for many, many weeks, in which the families had been wholly\\r\\ndivided. Four-and-twenty hours had never passed before, since August\\r\\nbegan, without bringing them together in some way or other. It was a\\r\\nsad, anxious day; and the morrow, though differing in the sort of evil,\\r\\ndid by no means bring less. A few moments of feverish enjoyment were\\r\\nfollowed by hours of acute suffering. Henry Crawford was again in the\\r\\nhouse: he walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respects\\r\\nto Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the\\r\\nbreakfast-room, where were most of the family. Sir Thomas soon appeared,\\r\\nand Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of the man she\\r\\nloved to her father. Her sensations were indefinable, and so were they\\r\\na few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford, who had a chair\\r\\nbetween herself and Tom, ask the latter in an undervoice whether\\r\\nthere were any plans for resuming the play after the present happy\\r\\ninterruption (with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in that\\r\\ncase, he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time\\r\\nrequired by the party: he was going away immediately, being to meet his\\r\\nuncle at Bath without delay; but if there were any prospect of a renewal\\r\\nof Lovers' Vows, he should hold himself positively engaged, he should\\r\\nbreak through every other claim, he should absolutely condition with his\\r\\nuncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted. The play should\\r\\nnot be lost by _his_ absence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will\\r\\nattend you from any place in England, at an hour's notice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was well at that moment that Tom had to speak, and not his sister. He\\r\\ncould immediately say with easy fluency, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry you are going;\\r\\nbut as to our play, _that_ is all over--entirely at an end\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (looking\\r\\nsignificantly at his father). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe painter was sent off yesterday, and\\r\\nvery little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew how _that_\\r\\nwould be from the first. It is early for Bath. You will find nobody\\r\\nthere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is about my uncle's usual time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen do you think of going?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhose stables do you use at Bath?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the next question; and while\\r\\nthis branch of the subject was under discussion, Maria, who wanted\\r\\nneither pride nor resolution, was preparing to encounter her share of it\\r\\nwith tolerable calmness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo her he soon turned, repeating much of what he had already said, with\\r\\nonly a softened air and stronger expressions of regret. But what availed\\r\\nhis expressions or his air? He was going, and, if not voluntarily going,\\r\\nvoluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting what might be due\\r\\nto his uncle, his engagements were all self-imposed. He might talk of\\r\\nnecessity, but she knew his independence. The hand which had so pressed\\r\\nhers to his heart! the hand and the heart were alike motionless and\\r\\npassive now! Her spirit supported her, but the agony of her mind was\\r\\nsevere. She had not long to endure what arose from listening to language\\r\\nwhich his actions contradicted, or to bury the tumult of her feelings\\r\\nunder the restraint of society; for general civilities soon called\\r\\nhis notice from her, and the farewell visit, as it then became openly\\r\\nacknowledged, was a very short one. He was gone--he had touched her\\r\\nhand for the last time, he had made his parting bow, and she might seek\\r\\ndirectly all that solitude could do for her. Henry Crawford was gone,\\r\\ngone from the house, and within two hours afterwards from the parish;\\r\\nand so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised in Maria and\\r\\nJulia Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulia could rejoice that he was gone. His presence was beginning to be\\r\\nodious to her; and if Maria gained him not, she was now cool enough to\\r\\ndispense with any other revenge. She did not want exposure to be added\\r\\nto desertion. Henry Crawford gone, she could even pity her sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence. She heard it\\r\\nat dinner, and felt it a blessing. By all the others it was mentioned\\r\\nwith regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling--from\\r\\nthe sincerity of Edmund's too partial regard, to the unconcern of his\\r\\nmother speaking entirely by rote. Mrs. Norris began to look about her,\\r\\nand wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing; and\\r\\ncould almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it; but\\r\\nwith so many to care for, how was it possible for even _her_ activity to\\r\\nkeep pace with her wishes?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise. In _his_ departure\\r\\nSir Thomas felt the chief interest: wanting to be alone with his family,\\r\\nthe presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been irksome;\\r\\nbut of him, trifling and confident, idle and expensive, it was every way\\r\\nvexatious. In himself he was wearisome, but as the friend of Tom and\\r\\nthe admirer of Julia he became offensive. Sir Thomas had been quite\\r\\nindifferent to Mr. Crawford's going or staying: but his good wishes\\r\\nfor Mr. Yates's having a pleasant journey, as he walked with him to the\\r\\nhall-door, were given with genuine satisfaction. Mr. Yates had staid to\\r\\nsee the destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield, the\\r\\nremoval of everything appertaining to the play: he left the house in all\\r\\nthe soberness of its general character; and Sir Thomas hoped, in seeing\\r\\nhim out of it, to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme,\\r\\nand the last that must be inevitably reminding him of its existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that might\\r\\nhave distressed him. The curtain, over which she had presided with such\\r\\ntalent and such success, went off with her to her cottage, where she\\r\\nhappened to be particularly in want of green baize.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas's return made a striking change in the ways of the family,\\r\\nindependent of Lovers' Vows. Under his government, Mansfield was an\\r\\naltered place. Some members of their society sent away, and the spirits\\r\\nof many others saddened--it was all sameness and gloom compared with\\r\\nthe past--a sombre family party rarely enlivened. There was little\\r\\nintercourse with the Parsonage. Sir Thomas, drawing back from intimacies\\r\\nin general, was particularly disinclined, at this time, for any\\r\\nengagements but in one quarter. The Rushworths were the only addition to\\r\\nhis own domestic circle which he could solicit.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund did not wonder that such should be his father's feelings, nor\\r\\ncould he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut they,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nobserved to Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave a claim. They seem to belong to us; they seem\\r\\nto be part of ourselves. I could wish my father were more sensible of\\r\\ntheir very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away. I\\r\\nam afraid they may feel themselves neglected. But the truth is, that my\\r\\nfather hardly knows them. They had not been here a twelvemonth when he\\r\\nleft England. If he knew them better, he would value their society as it\\r\\ndeserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would\\r\\nlike. We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves: my\\r\\nsisters seem out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at his ease. Dr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings pass away with\\r\\nmore enjoyment even to my father.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin my opinion, my uncle would not like\\r\\n_any_ addition. I think he values the very quietness you speak of, and\\r\\nthat the repose of his own family circle is all he wants. And it does\\r\\nnot appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be--I mean\\r\\nbefore my uncle went abroad. As well as I can recollect, it was always\\r\\nmuch the same. There was never much laughing in his presence; or, if\\r\\nthere is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence\\r\\nhas a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness; but\\r\\nI cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry, except\\r\\nwhen my uncle was in town. No young people's are, I suppose, when those\\r\\nthey look up to are at home\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe you are right, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his reply, after a short\\r\\nconsideration. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe our evenings are rather returned to what they\\r\\nwere, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their being\\r\\nlively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give!\\r\\nI have been feeling as if we had never lived so before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose I am graver than other people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe evenings do\\r\\nnot appear long to me. I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies.\\r\\nI could listen to him for an hour together. It entertains _me_ more than\\r\\nmany other things have done; but then I am unlike other people, I dare\\r\\nsay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy should you dare say _that_?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (smiling). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you want to be told\\r\\nthat you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet?\\r\\nBut when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny? Go\\r\\nto my father if you want to be complimented. He will satisfy you. Ask\\r\\nyour uncle what he thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: and\\r\\nthough they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and\\r\\ntrust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny--and that is the long and\\r\\nthe short of the matter. Anybody but myself would have made something\\r\\nmore of it, and anybody but you would resent that you had not been\\r\\nthought very pretty before; but the truth is, that your uncle never\\r\\ndid admire you till now--and now he does. Your complexion is so\\r\\nimproved!--and you have gained so much countenance!--and your\\r\\nfigure--nay, Fanny, do not turn away about it--it is but an uncle. If\\r\\nyou cannot bear an uncle's admiration, what is to become of you? You\\r\\nmust really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking\\r\\nat. You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! don't talk so, don't talk so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny, distressed by more\\r\\nfeelings than he was aware of; but seeing that she was distressed, he\\r\\nhad done with the subject, and only added more seriously--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect; and I\\r\\nonly wish you would talk to him more. You are one of those who are too\\r\\nsilent in the evening circle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I do talk to him more than I used. I am sure I do. Did not you hear\\r\\nme ask him about the slave-trade last night?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did--and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others. It\\r\\nwould have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I longed to do it--but there was such a dead silence! And while\\r\\nmy cousins were sitting by without speaking a word, or seeming at all\\r\\ninterested in the subject, I did not like--I thought it would appear as\\r\\nif I wanted to set myself off at their expense, by shewing a curiosity\\r\\nand pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to\\r\\nfeel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day:\\r\\nthat you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women\\r\\nwere of neglect. We were talking of you at the Parsonage, and those were\\r\\nher words. She has great discernment. I know nobody who distinguishes\\r\\ncharacters better. For so young a woman it is remarkable! She certainly\\r\\nunderstands _you_ better than you are understood by the greater part of\\r\\nthose who have known you so long; and with regard to some others, I can\\r\\nperceive, from occasional lively hints, the unguarded expressions of\\r\\nthe moment, that she could define _many_ as accurately, did not delicacy\\r\\nforbid it. I wonder what she thinks of my father! She must admire him\\r\\nas a fine-looking man, with most gentlemanlike, dignified, consistent\\r\\nmanners; but perhaps, having seen him so seldom, his reserve may be\\r\\na little repulsive. Could they be much together, I feel sure of their\\r\\nliking each other. He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to\\r\\nvalue his powers. I wish they met more frequently! I hope she does not\\r\\nsuppose there is any dislike on his side.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Fanny, with half a sigh, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto have any such apprehension. And Sir\\r\\nThomas's wishing just at first to be only with his family, is so very\\r\\nnatural, that she can argue nothing from that. After a little while, I\\r\\ndare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way, allowing\\r\\nfor the difference of the time of year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the first October that she has passed in the country since her\\r\\ninfancy. I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country; and November\\r\\nis a still more serious month, and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very\\r\\nanxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to say nothing, and\\r\\nleave untouched all Miss Crawford's resources--her accomplishments, her\\r\\nspirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her into\\r\\nany observations seemingly unhandsome. Miss Crawford's kind opinion of\\r\\nherself deserved at least a grateful forbearance, and she began to talk\\r\\nof something else.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you and Mr.\\r\\nBertram too. We shall be quite a small party at home. I hope my uncle\\r\\nmay continue to like Mr. Rushworth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is impossible, Fanny. He must like him less after to-morrow's\\r\\nvisit, for we shall be five hours in his company. I should dread\\r\\nthe stupidity of the day, if there were not a much greater evil to\\r\\nfollow--the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas. He cannot much\\r\\nlonger deceive himself. I am sorry for them all, and would give\\r\\nsomething that Rushworth and Maria had never met.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas.\\r\\nNot all his good-will for Mr. Rushworth, not all Mr. Rushworth's\\r\\ndeference for him, could prevent him from soon discerning some part of\\r\\nthe truth--that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorant\\r\\nin business as in books, with opinions in general unfixed, and without\\r\\nseeming much aware of it himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning to feel\\r\\ngrave on Maria's account, tried to understand _her_ feelings. Little\\r\\nobservation there was necessary to tell him that indifference was the\\r\\nmost favourable state they could be in. Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth\\r\\nwas careless and cold. She could not, did not like him. Sir Thomas\\r\\nresolved to speak seriously to her. Advantageous as would be the\\r\\nalliance, and long standing and public as was the engagement, her\\r\\nhappiness must not be sacrificed to it. Mr. Rushworth had, perhaps, been\\r\\naccepted on too short an acquaintance, and, on knowing him better, she\\r\\nwas repenting.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her: told her his fears,\\r\\ninquired into her wishes, entreated her to be open and sincere, and\\r\\nassured her that every inconvenience should be braved, and the connexion\\r\\nentirely given up, if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it. He\\r\\nwould act for her and release her. Maria had a moment's struggle as she\\r\\nlistened, and only a moment's: when her father ceased, she was able to\\r\\ngive her answer immediately, decidedly, and with no apparent agitation.\\r\\nShe thanked him for his great attention, his paternal kindness, but he\\r\\nwas quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking\\r\\nthrough her engagement, or was sensible of any change of opinion or\\r\\ninclination since her forming it. She had the highest esteem for Mr.\\r\\nRushworth's character and disposition, and could not have a doubt of her\\r\\nhappiness with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas was satisfied; too glad to be satisfied, perhaps, to urge the\\r\\nmatter quite so far as his judgment might have dictated to others. It\\r\\nwas an alliance which he could not have relinquished without pain;\\r\\nand thus he reasoned. Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve. Mr.\\r\\nRushworth must and would improve in good society; and if Maria could now\\r\\nspeak so securely of her happiness with him, speaking certainly without\\r\\nthe prejudice, the blindness of love, she ought to be believed. Her\\r\\nfeelings, probably, were not acute; he had never supposed them to be\\r\\nso; but her comforts might not be less on that account; and if she could\\r\\ndispense with seeing her husband a leading, shining character, there\\r\\nwould certainly be everything else in her favour. A well-disposed young\\r\\nwoman, who did not marry for love, was in general but the more attached\\r\\nto her own family; and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield\\r\\nmust naturally hold out the greatest temptation, and would, in all\\r\\nprobability, be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent\\r\\nenjoyments. Such and such-like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas,\\r\\nhappy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture, the wonder,\\r\\nthe reflections, the reproach that must attend it; happy to secure a\\r\\nmarriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability\\r\\nand influence, and very happy to think anything of his daughter's\\r\\ndisposition that was most favourable for the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him. She was in a\\r\\nstate of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall:\\r\\nthat she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton; that she was safe from\\r\\nthe possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions,\\r\\nand destroying her prospects; and retired in proud resolve, determined\\r\\nonly to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future, that her\\r\\nfather might not be again suspecting her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four\\r\\ndays after Henry Crawford's leaving Mansfield, before her feelings were\\r\\nat all tranquillised, before she had given up every hope of him, or\\r\\nabsolutely resolved on enduring his rival, her answer might have been\\r\\ndifferent; but after another three or four days, when there was no\\r\\nreturn, no letter, no message, no symptom of a softened heart, no hope\\r\\nof advantage from separation, her mind became cool enough to seek all\\r\\nthe comfort that pride and self revenge could give.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Crawford had destroyed her happiness, but he should not know that\\r\\nhe had done it; he should not destroy her credit, her appearance, her\\r\\nprosperity, too. He should not have to think of her as pining in the\\r\\nretirement of Mansfield for _him_, rejecting Sotherton and London,\\r\\nindependence and splendour, for _his_ sake. Independence was more\\r\\nneedful than ever; the want of it at Mansfield more sensibly felt. She\\r\\nwas less and less able to endure the restraint which her father imposed.\\r\\nThe liberty which his absence had given was now become absolutely\\r\\nnecessary. She must escape from him and Mansfield as soon as possible,\\r\\nand find consolation in fortune and consequence, bustle and the world,\\r\\nfor a wounded spirit. Her mind was quite determined, and varied not.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such feelings delay, even the delay of much preparation, would have\\r\\nbeen an evil, and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the\\r\\nmarriage than herself. In all the important preparations of the mind\\r\\nshe was complete: being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home,\\r\\nrestraint, and tranquillity; by the misery of disappointed affection,\\r\\nand contempt of the man she was to marry. The rest might wait. The\\r\\npreparations of new carriages and furniture might wait for London and\\r\\nspring, when her own taste could have fairer play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principals being all agreed in this respect, it soon appeared that a\\r\\nvery few weeks would be sufficient for such arrangements as must precede\\r\\nthe wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire, and make way for the fortunate\\r\\nyoung woman whom her dear son had selected; and very early in November\\r\\nremoved herself, her maid, her footman, and her chariot, with true\\r\\ndowager propriety, to Bath, there to parade over the wonders of\\r\\nSotherton in her evening parties; enjoying them as thoroughly, perhaps,\\r\\nin the animation of a card-table, as she had ever done on the spot; and\\r\\nbefore the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which\\r\\ngave Sotherton another mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very proper wedding. The bride was elegantly dressed; the two\\r\\nbridesmaids were duly inferior; her father gave her away; her mother\\r\\nstood with salts in her hand, expecting to be agitated; her aunt tried\\r\\nto cry; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant. Nothing\\r\\ncould be objected to when it came under the discussion of the\\r\\nneighbourhood, except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and\\r\\nbridegroom and Julia from the church-door to Sotherton was the same\\r\\nchaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before. In\\r\\neverything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictest\\r\\ninvestigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was done, and they were gone. Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father\\r\\nmust feel, and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his\\r\\nwife had been apprehensive of for herself, but had fortunately escaped.\\r\\nMrs. Norris, most happy to assist in the duties of the day, by spending\\r\\nit at the Park to support her sister's spirits, and drinking the health\\r\\nof Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two, was all\\r\\njoyous delight; for she had made the match; she had done everything;\\r\\nand no one would have supposed, from her confident triumph, that she\\r\\nhad ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life, or could have the\\r\\nsmallest insight into the disposition of the niece who had been brought\\r\\nup under her eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan of the young couple was to proceed, after a few days, to\\r\\nBrighton, and take a house there for some weeks. Every public place was\\r\\nnew to Maria, and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer. When\\r\\nthe novelty of amusement there was over, it would be time for the wider\\r\\nrange of London.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulia was to go with them to Brighton. Since rivalry between the sisters\\r\\nhad ceased, they had been gradually recovering much of their former good\\r\\nunderstanding; and were at least sufficiently friends to make each of\\r\\nthem exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time. Some other\\r\\ncompanion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady;\\r\\nand Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria, though\\r\\nshe might not have struggled through so much to obtain them, and could\\r\\nbetter bear a subordinate situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir departure made another material change at Mansfield, a chasm\\r\\nwhich required some time to fill up. The family circle became greatly\\r\\ncontracted; and though the Miss Bertrams had latterly added little to\\r\\nits gaiety, they could not but be missed. Even their mother missed them;\\r\\nand how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered about\\r\\nthe house, and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree of\\r\\naffectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's consequence increased on the departure of her cousins. Becoming,\\r\\nas she then did, the only young woman in the drawing-room, the only\\r\\noccupier of that interesting division of a family in which she had\\r\\nhitherto held so humble a third, it was impossible for her not to be\\r\\nmore looked at, more thought of and attended to, than she had ever been\\r\\nbefore; and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is Fanny?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d became no uncommon question, even without\\r\\nher being wanted for any one's convenience.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only at home did her value increase, but at the Parsonage too. In\\r\\nthat house, which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr. Norris's\\r\\ndeath, she became a welcome, an invited guest, and in the gloom and dirt\\r\\nof a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford. Her visits there,\\r\\nbeginning by chance, were continued by solicitation. Mrs. Grant,\\r\\nreally eager to get any change for her sister, could, by the easiest\\r\\nself-deceit, persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing by\\r\\nFanny, and giving her the most important opportunities of improvement in\\r\\npressing her frequent calls.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, having been sent into the village on some errand by her aunt\\r\\nNorris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage; and\\r\\nbeing descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter\\r\\nunder the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their\\r\\npremises, was forced, though not without some modest reluctance on her\\r\\npart, to come in. A civil servant she had withstood; but when Dr. Grant\\r\\nhimself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to\\r\\nbe very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible; and\\r\\nto poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal rain\\r\\nin a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all her\\r\\nplan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a\\r\\nsingle creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the\\r\\nsound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price\\r\\ndripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful. The value of an\\r\\nevent on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her.\\r\\nShe was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being\\r\\nuseful to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first\\r\\nallow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny, after being\\r\\nobliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and\\r\\nwaited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning\\r\\ndownstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the rain\\r\\ncontinued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus\\r\\nextended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits to the period\\r\\nof dressing and dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant, that Fanny might\\r\\nhave enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way,\\r\\nand could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at\\r\\nthe end of the hour, and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant's\\r\\ncarriage and horses out to take her home, with which she was threatened.\\r\\nAs to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might\\r\\noccasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that score; for as her\\r\\nbeing out was known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly aware that\\r\\nnone would be felt, and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse\\r\\nto establish her during the rain, her being in such cottage would be\\r\\nindubitable to aunt Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in the\\r\\nroom, asked some questions about it, which soon led to an acknowledgment\\r\\nof her wishing very much to hear it, and a confession, which could\\r\\nhardly be believed, of her having never yet heard it since its being\\r\\nin Mansfield. To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and natural\\r\\ncircumstance. She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since the\\r\\ninstrument's arrival, there had been no reason that she should; but Miss\\r\\nCrawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject, was\\r\\nconcerned at her own neglect; and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall I play to you now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\nwill you have?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were questions immediately following with the readiest\\r\\ngood-humour.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe played accordingly; happy to have a new listener, and a listener who\\r\\nseemed so much obliged, so full of wonder at the performance, and who\\r\\nshewed herself not wanting in taste. She played till Fanny's eyes,\\r\\nstraying to the window on the weather's being evidently fair, spoke what\\r\\nshe felt must be done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnother quarter of an hour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand we shall see how\\r\\nit will be. Do not run away the first moment of its holding up. Those\\r\\nclouds look alarming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut they are passed over,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been watching them. This\\r\\nweather is all from the south.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSouth or north, I know a black cloud when I see it; and you must not\\r\\nset forward while it is so threatening. And besides, I want to play\\r\\nsomething more to you--a very pretty piece--and your cousin Edmund's\\r\\nprime favourite. You must stay and hear your cousin's favourite.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny felt that she must; and though she had not waited for that\\r\\nsentence to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her particularly\\r\\nawake to his idea, and she fancied him sitting in that room again\\r\\nand again, perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with\\r\\nconstant delight to the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her,\\r\\nwith superior tone and expression; and though pleased with it herself,\\r\\nand glad to like whatever was liked by him, she was more sincerely\\r\\nimpatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before;\\r\\nand on this being evident, she was so kindly asked to call again, to\\r\\ntake them in her walk whenever she could, to come and hear more of the\\r\\nharp, that she felt it necessary to be done, if no objection arose at\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between\\r\\nthem within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams' going away--an\\r\\nintimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford's desire of something\\r\\nnew, and which had little reality in Fanny's feelings. Fanny went to her\\r\\nevery two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she could not\\r\\nbe easy without going, and yet it was without loving her, without ever\\r\\nthinking like her, without any sense of obligation for being sought\\r\\nafter now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no higher\\r\\npleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement, and _that_\\r\\noften at the expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry\\r\\non people or subjects which she wished to be respected. She went,\\r\\nhowever, and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs.\\r\\nGrant's shrubbery, the weather being unusually mild for the time of\\r\\nyear, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now\\r\\ncomparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the midst\\r\\nof some tender ejaculation of Fanny's on the sweets of so protracted\\r\\nan autumn, they were forced, by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking\\r\\ndown the last few yellow leaves about them, to jump up and walk for\\r\\nwarmth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is pretty, very pretty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, looking around her as\\r\\nthey were thus sitting together one day; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cevery time I come into this\\r\\nshrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty. Three years ago,\\r\\nthis was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field,\\r\\nnever thought of as anything, or capable of becoming anything; and now\\r\\nit is converted into a walk, and it would be difficult to say whether\\r\\nmost valuable as a convenience or an ornament; and perhaps, in another\\r\\nthree years, we may be forgetting--almost forgetting what it was before.\\r\\nHow wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and the\\r\\nchanges of the human mind!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And following the latter train of thought,\\r\\nshe soon afterwards added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf any one faculty of our nature may be\\r\\ncalled _more_ wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There\\r\\nseems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers,\\r\\nthe failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our\\r\\nintelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so\\r\\nobedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so\\r\\ntyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way;\\r\\nbut our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past\\r\\nfinding out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing to say; and\\r\\nFanny, perceiving it, brought back her own mind to what she thought must\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may seem impertinent in _me_ to praise, but I must admire the taste\\r\\nMrs. Grant has shewn in all this. There is such a quiet simplicity in\\r\\nthe plan of the walk! Not too much attempted!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Crawford carelessly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit does very well for a\\r\\nplace of this sort. One does not think of extent _here_; and between\\r\\nourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country parson\\r\\never aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, in reply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy\\r\\nuncle's gardener always says the soil here is better than his own, and\\r\\nso it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general.\\r\\nThe evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen!\\r\\nWhen one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some\\r\\ncountries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that\\r\\ndoes not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should\\r\\nnurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence.\\r\\nYou will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especially\\r\\nwhen I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of\\r\\nwondering strain. One cannot fix one's eyes on the commonest natural\\r\\nproduction without finding food for a rambling fancy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo say the truth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am something like the\\r\\nfamous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.; and may declare that I see no\\r\\nwonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody had\\r\\ntold me a year ago that this place would be my home, that I should be\\r\\nspending month after month here, as I have done, I certainly should\\r\\nnot have believed them. I have now been here nearly five months; and,\\r\\nmoreover, the quietest five months I ever passed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Too_ quiet for you, I believe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should have thought so _theoretically_ myself, but,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and her eyes\\r\\nbrightened as she spoke, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctake it all and all, I never spent so happy a\\r\\nsummer. But then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\r\\nis no saying what it may lead to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's heart beat quick, and she felt quite unequal to surmising\\r\\nor soliciting anything more. Miss Crawford, however, with renewed\\r\\nanimation, soon went on--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence\\r\\nthan I had ever expected to be. I can even suppose it pleasant to\\r\\nspend _half_ the year in the country, under certain circumstances,\\r\\nvery pleasant. An elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of family\\r\\nconnexions; continual engagements among them; commanding the first\\r\\nsociety in the neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading it even\\r\\nmore than those of larger fortune, and turning from the cheerful round\\r\\nof such amusements to nothing worse than a _tete-a-tete_ with the person\\r\\none feels most agreeable in the world. There is nothing frightful in\\r\\nsuch a picture, is there, Miss Price? One need not envy the new Mrs.\\r\\nRushworth with such a home as _that_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEnvy Mrs. Rushworth!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was all that Fanny attempted to say. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome, come,\\r\\nit would be very un-handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth, for I\\r\\nlook forward to our owing her a great many gay, brilliant, happy hours.\\r\\nI expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year. Such\\r\\na match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing; for the first\\r\\npleasures of Mr. Rushworth's wife must be to fill her house, and give\\r\\nthe best balls in the country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness, till\\r\\nsuddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes, she exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\r\\nhere he is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund, who then\\r\\nappeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy sister and Mr.\\r\\nBertram. I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone, that he may be Mr.\\r\\nBertram again. There is something in the sound of Mr. _Edmund_ Bertram\\r\\nso formal, so pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow differently we feel!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo me, the sound of _Mr._\\r\\nBertram is so cold and nothing-meaning, so entirely without warmth or\\r\\ncharacter! It just stands for a gentleman, and that's all. But there is\\r\\nnobleness in the name of Edmund. It is a name of heroism and renown; of\\r\\nkings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry\\r\\nand warm affections.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI grant you the name is good in itself, and _Lord_ Edmund or _Sir_\\r\\nEdmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill, the annihilation\\r\\nof a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas. Well,\\r\\nshall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting\\r\\ndown out of doors at this time of year, by being up before they can\\r\\nbegin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund met them with particular pleasure. It was the first time of his\\r\\nseeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintance\\r\\nwhich he had been hearing of with great satisfaction. A friendship\\r\\nbetween two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished:\\r\\nand to the credit of the lover's understanding, be it stated, that he\\r\\ndid not by any means consider Fanny as the only, or even as the greater\\r\\ngainer by such a friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand do you not scold us for our imprudence?\\r\\nWhat do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to\\r\\nabout it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I might have scolded,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif either of you had been\\r\\nsitting down alone; but while you do wrong together, I can overlook a\\r\\ngreat deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey cannot have been sitting long,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Grant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor when I went\\r\\nup for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window, and then they were\\r\\nwalking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd really,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe day is so mild, that your sitting down\\r\\nfor a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent. Our weather must\\r\\nnot always be judged by the calendar. We may sometimes take greater\\r\\nliberties in November than in May.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are two of the most\\r\\ndisappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with! There is no\\r\\ngiving you a moment's uneasiness. You do not know how much we have been\\r\\nsuffering, nor what chills we have felt! But I have long thought Mr.\\r\\nBertram one of the worst subjects to work on, in any little manoeuvre\\r\\nagainst common sense, that a woman could be plagued with. I had very\\r\\nlittle hope of _him_ from the first; but you, Mrs. Grant, my sister, my\\r\\nown sister, I think I had a right to alarm you a little.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary. You have not the smallest\\r\\nchance of moving me. I have my alarms, but they are quite in a different\\r\\nquarter; and if I could have altered the weather, you would have had a\\r\\ngood sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time--for here are some of\\r\\nmy plants which Robert _will_ leave out because the nights are so mild,\\r\\nand I know the end of it will be, that we shall have a sudden change of\\r\\nweather, a hard frost setting in all at once, taking everybody (at least\\r\\nRobert) by surprise, and I shall lose every one; and what is worse, cook\\r\\nhas just been telling me that the turkey, which I particularly wished\\r\\nnot to be dressed till Sunday, because I know how much more Dr. Grant\\r\\nwould enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day, will not keep\\r\\nbeyond to-morrow. These are something like grievances, and make me think\\r\\nthe weather most unseasonably close.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe sweets of housekeeping in a country village!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford\\r\\narchly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St.\\r\\nPaul's, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you\\r\\ncould be. But we have no such people in Mansfield. What would you have\\r\\nme do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! you can do nothing but what you do already: be plagued very often,\\r\\nand never lose your temper.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, live\\r\\nwhere we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, I\\r\\ndare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and\\r\\nthe poulterer, perhaps on their very account. Their remoteness and\\r\\nunpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing\\r\\nforth bitter lamentations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort.\\r\\nA large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. It\\r\\ncertainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou intend to be very rich?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, with a look which, to Fanny's\\r\\neye, had a great deal of serious meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure. Do not you? Do not we all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power\\r\\nto command. Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth. She has only\\r\\nto fix on her number of thousands a year, and there can be no doubt of\\r\\ntheir coming. My intentions are only not to be poor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy moderation and economy, and bringing down your wants to your income,\\r\\nand all that. I understand you--and a very proper plan it is for a\\r\\nperson at your time of life, with such limited means and indifferent\\r\\nconnexions. What can _you_ want but a decent maintenance? You have\\r\\nnot much time before you; and your relations are in no situation to do\\r\\nanything for you, or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth\\r\\nand consequence. Be honest and poor, by all means--but I shall not envy\\r\\nyou; I do not much think I shall even respect you. I have a much greater\\r\\nrespect for those that are honest and rich.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor, is precisely what\\r\\nI have no manner of concern with. I do not mean to be poor. Poverty\\r\\nis exactly what I have determined against. Honesty, in the something\\r\\nbetween, in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that I am\\r\\nanxious for your not looking down on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I do look down upon it, if it might have been higher. I must\\r\\nlook down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to\\r\\ndistinction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut how may it rise? How may my honesty at least rise to any\\r\\ndistinction?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not so very easy a question to answer, and occasioned an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n of some length from the fair lady before she could add, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou ought to be\\r\\nin parliament, or you should have gone into the army ten years ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c_That_ is not much to the purpose now; and as to my being in\\r\\nparliament, I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for\\r\\nthe representation of younger sons who have little to live on. No, Miss\\r\\nCrawford,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, in a more serious tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere _are_ distinctions\\r\\nwhich I should be miserable if I thought myself without any\\r\\nchance--absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining--but they\\r\\nare of a different character.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed a consciousness\\r\\nof manner on Miss Crawford's side as she made some laughing answer,\\r\\nwas sorrowfull food for Fanny's observation; and finding herself quite\\r\\nunable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she was now\\r\\nfollowing the others, she had nearly resolved on going home immediately,\\r\\nand only waited for courage to say so, when the sound of the great clock\\r\\nat Mansfield Park, striking three, made her feel that she had\\r\\nreally been much longer absent than usual, and brought the previous\\r\\nself-inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just then, and how,\\r\\nto a very speedy issue. With undoubting decision she directly began her\\r\\nadieus; and Edmund began at the same time to recollect that his mother\\r\\nhad been inquiring for her, and that he had walked down to the Parsonage\\r\\non purpose to bring her back.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's hurry increased; and without in the least expecting Edmund's\\r\\nattendance, she would have hastened away alone; but the general pace was\\r\\nquickened, and they all accompanied her into the house, through which it\\r\\nwas necessary to pass. Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as they stopt\\r\\nto speak to him she found, from Edmund's manner, that he _did_ mean to\\r\\ngo with her. He too was taking leave. She could not but be thankful. In\\r\\nthe moment of parting, Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his mutton\\r\\nwith him the next day; and Fanny had barely time for an unpleasant\\r\\nfeeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant, with sudden recollection,\\r\\nturned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company too. This was\\r\\nso new an attention, so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of\\r\\nFanny's life, that she was all surprise and embarrassment; and while\\r\\nstammering out her great obligation, and her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut she did not suppose it\\r\\nwould be in her power,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was looking at Edmund for his opinion and help.\\r\\nBut Edmund, delighted with her having such an happiness offered, and\\r\\nascertaining with half a look, and half a sentence, that she had no\\r\\nobjection but on her aunt's account, could not imagine that his mother\\r\\nwould make any difficulty of sparing her, and therefore gave his decided\\r\\nopen advice that the invitation should be accepted; and though Fanny\\r\\nwould not venture, even on his encouragement, to such a flight of\\r\\naudacious independence, it was soon settled, that if nothing were heard\\r\\nto the contrary, Mrs. Grant might expect her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you know what your dinner will be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Grant, smiling--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\r\\nturkey, and I assure you a very fine one; for, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d turning to her\\r\\nhusband, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccook insists upon the turkey's being dressed to-morrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Dr. Grant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9call the better; I am glad\\r\\nto hear you have anything so good in the house. But Miss Price and Mr.\\r\\nEdmund Bertram, I dare say, would take their chance. We none of us want\\r\\nto hear the bill of fare. A friendly meeting, and not a fine dinner,\\r\\nis all we have in view. A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton, or\\r\\nwhatever you and your cook chuse to give us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two cousins walked home together; and, except in the immediate\\r\\ndiscussion of this engagement, which Edmund spoke of with the warmest\\r\\nsatisfaction, as so particularly desirable for her in the intimacy which\\r\\nhe saw with so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk; for\\r\\nhaving finished that subject, he grew thoughtful and indisposed for any\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow came she\\r\\nto think of asking Fanny? Fanny never dines there, you know, in this\\r\\nsort of way. I cannot spare her, and I am sure she does not want to go.\\r\\nFanny, you do not want to go, do you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you put such a question to her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Edmund, preventing his\\r\\ncousin's speaking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny will immediately say No; but I am sure, my\\r\\ndear mother, she would like to go; and I can see no reason why she\\r\\nshould not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her? She never\\r\\ndid before. She used to ask your sisters now and then, but she never\\r\\nasked Fanny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you cannot do without me, ma'am--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, in a self-denying\\r\\ntone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut my mother will have my father with her all the evening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, so I shall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuppose you take my father's opinion, ma'am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's well thought of. So I will, Edmund. I will ask Sir Thomas, as\\r\\nsoon as he comes in, whether I can do without her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs you please, ma'am, on that head; but I meant my father's opinion\\r\\nas to the _propriety_ of the invitation's being accepted or not; and\\r\\nI think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by\\r\\nFanny, that being the _first_ invitation it should be accepted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know. We will ask him. But he will be very much surprised that\\r\\nMrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing more to be said, or that could be said to any purpose,\\r\\ntill Sir Thomas were present; but the subject involving, as it did,\\r\\nher own evening's comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in Lady\\r\\nBertram's mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his looking in for a\\r\\nminute in his way from his plantation to his dressing-room, she called\\r\\nhim back again, when he had almost closed the door, with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas,\\r\\nstop a moment--I have something to say to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer tone of calm languor, for she never took the trouble of raising her\\r\\nvoice, was always heard and attended to; and Sir Thomas came back. Her\\r\\nstory began; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room; for to hear\\r\\nherself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her\\r\\nnerves could bear. She was anxious, she knew--more anxious perhaps than\\r\\nshe ought to be--for what was it after all whether she went or staid?\\r\\nbut if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding, and\\r\\nwith very grave looks, and those grave looks directed to her, and\\r\\nat last decide against her, she might not be able to appear properly\\r\\nsubmissive and indifferent. Her cause, meanwhile, went on well. It\\r\\nbegan, on Lady Bertram's part, with--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have something to tell you that\\r\\nwill surprise you. Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEdmund wants her to go. But how can I spare her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe will be late,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, taking out his watch; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut what is\\r\\nyour difficulty?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his\\r\\nmother's story. He told the whole; and she had only to add, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo strange!\\r\\nfor Mrs. Grant never used to ask her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut is it not very natural,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Mrs. Grant should\\r\\nwish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing can be more natural,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, after a short\\r\\ndeliberation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnor, were there no sister in the case, could anything,\\r\\nin my opinion, be more natural. Mrs. Grant's shewing civility to Miss\\r\\nPrice, to Lady Bertram's niece, could never want explanation. The only\\r\\nsurprise I can feel is, that this should be the _first_ time of its\\r\\nbeing paid. Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional\\r\\nanswer. She appears to feel as she ought. But as I conclude that she\\r\\nmust wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see\\r\\nno reason why she should be denied the indulgence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut can I do without her, Sir Thomas?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I think you may.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us, and\\r\\nI shall certainly be at home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news soon followed her. Edmund knocked at her door in his way\\r\\nto his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without the smallest\\r\\nhesitation on your uncle's side. He had but one opinion. You are to go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, I am _so_ glad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Fanny's instinctive reply; though when\\r\\nshe had turned from him and shut the door, she could not help feeling,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet why should I be glad? for am I not certain of seeing or hearing\\r\\nsomething there to pain me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of this conviction, however, she was glad. Simple as such an\\r\\nengagement might appear in other eyes, it had novelty and importance in\\r\\nhers, for excepting the day at Sotherton, she had scarcely ever dined\\r\\nout before; and though now going only half a mile, and only to three\\r\\npeople, still it was dining out, and all the little interests of\\r\\npreparation were enjoyments in themselves. She had neither sympathy nor\\r\\nassistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and\\r\\ndirected her taste; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to\\r\\nanybody, and Mrs. Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence of\\r\\nan early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill humour,\\r\\nand seemed intent only on lessening her niece's pleasure, both present\\r\\nand future, as much as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet with such attention\\r\\nand indulgence! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for\\r\\nthinking of you, and to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought to\\r\\nlook upon it as something extraordinary; for I hope you are aware that\\r\\nthere is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of\\r\\nway, or ever dining out at all; and it is what you must not depend upon\\r\\never being repeated. Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is\\r\\nmeant as any particular compliment to _you_; the compliment is intended\\r\\nto your uncle and aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to\\r\\n_us_ to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have come\\r\\ninto her head, and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia\\r\\nhad been at home, you would not have been asked at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant's part of\\r\\nthe favour, that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could only\\r\\nsay that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her,\\r\\nand that she was endeavouring to put her aunt's evening work in such a\\r\\nstate as to prevent her being missed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you, or you\\r\\nwould not be allowed to go. _I_ shall be here, so you may be quite easy\\r\\nabout your aunt. And I hope you will have a very _agreeable_ day, and\\r\\nfind it all mighty _delightful_. But I must observe that five is the\\r\\nvery awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I\\r\\ncannot but be surprised that such an _elegant_ lady as Mrs. Grant should\\r\\nnot contrive better! And round their enormous great wide table, too,\\r\\nwhich fills up the room so dreadfully! Had the doctor been contented to\\r\\ntake my dining-table when I came away, as anybody in their senses would\\r\\nhave done, instead of having that absurd new one of his own, which is\\r\\nwider, literally wider than the dinner-table here, how infinitely better\\r\\nit would have been! and how much more he would have been respected! for\\r\\npeople are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere.\\r\\nRemember that, Fanny. Five--only five to be sitting round that table.\\r\\nHowever, you will have dinner enough on it for ten, I dare say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe nonsense and folly of people's stepping out of their rank and\\r\\ntrying to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give _you_\\r\\na hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of us;\\r\\nand I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward, and\\r\\ntalking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins--as\\r\\nif you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia. _That_ will never do, believe\\r\\nme. Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and last; and\\r\\nthough Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage, you are\\r\\nnot to be taking place of her. And as to coming away at night, you are\\r\\nto stay just as long as Edmund chuses. Leave him to settle _that_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, ma'am, I should not think of anything else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely, for I never\\r\\nsaw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life, you must manage as\\r\\nwell as you can, and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you. I\\r\\ncertainly do not go home to-night, and, therefore, the carriage will not\\r\\nbe out on my account; so you must make up your mind to what may happen,\\r\\nand take your things accordingly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer niece thought it perfectly reasonable. She rated her own claims\\r\\nto comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could; and when Sir Thomas soon\\r\\nafterwards, just opening the door, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny, at what time would you\\r\\nhave the carriage come round?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she felt a degree of astonishment which\\r\\nmade it impossible for her to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Sir Thomas!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny can\\r\\nwalk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWalk!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable dignity, and\\r\\ncoming farther into the room. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy niece walk to a dinner engagement at\\r\\nthis time of the year! Will twenty minutes after four suit you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Fanny's humble answer, given with the feelings almost\\r\\nof a criminal towards Mrs. Norris; and not bearing to remain with her\\r\\nin what might seem a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of\\r\\nthe room, having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words\\r\\nspoken in angry agitation--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite unnecessary! a great deal too kind! But Edmund goes; true, it is\\r\\nupon Edmund's account. I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this could not impose on Fanny. She felt that the carriage was for\\r\\nherself, and herself alone: and her uncle's consideration of her, coming\\r\\nimmediately after such representations from her aunt, cost her some\\r\\ntears of gratitude when she was alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coachman drove round to a minute; another minute brought down the\\r\\ngentleman; and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of being\\r\\nlate, been many minutes seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them\\r\\noff in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I must look at you, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, with the kind smile of an\\r\\naffectionate brother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand tell you how I like you; and as well as I can\\r\\njudge by this light, you look very nicely indeed. What have you got on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin's\\r\\nmarriage. I hope it is not too fine; but I thought I ought to wear it as\\r\\nsoon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity all\\r\\nthe winter. I hope you do not think me too fine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA woman can never be too fine while she is all in white. No, I see no\\r\\nfinery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper. Your gown seems\\r\\nvery pretty. I like these glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gown\\r\\nsomething the same?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard and\\r\\ncoach-house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeyday!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chere's company, here's a carriage! who have they\\r\\ngot to meet us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And letting down the side-glass to distinguish, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c'Tis\\r\\nCrawford's, Crawford's barouche, I protest! There are his own two men\\r\\npushing it back into its old quarters. He is here, of course. This is\\r\\nquite a surprise, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny to say how very\\r\\ndifferently she felt; but the idea of having such another to observe\\r\\nher was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed the\\r\\nvery awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the drawing-room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been just long\\r\\nenough arrived to be ready for dinner; and the smiles and pleased looks\\r\\nof the three others standing round him, shewed how welcome was his\\r\\nsudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath.\\r\\nA very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund; and with the\\r\\nexception of Fanny, the pleasure was general; and even to _her_ there\\r\\nmight be some advantage in his presence, since every addition to the\\r\\nparty must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to\\r\\nsit silent and unattended to. She was soon aware of this herself; for\\r\\nthough she must submit, as her own propriety of mind directed, in spite\\r\\nof her aunt Norris's opinion, to being the principal lady in company,\\r\\nand to all the little distinctions consequent thereon, she found, while\\r\\nthey were at table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, in\\r\\nwhich she was not required to take any part--there was so much to be\\r\\nsaid between the brother and sister about Bath, so much between the two\\r\\nyoung men about hunting, so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and\\r\\nDr. Grant, and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford\\r\\nand Mrs. Grant, as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only\\r\\nto listen in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day. She could not\\r\\ncompliment the newly arrived gentleman, however, with any appearance of\\r\\ninterest, in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield, and sending\\r\\nfor his hunters from Norfolk, which, suggested by Dr. Grant, advised by\\r\\nEdmund, and warmly urged by the two sisters, was soon in possession of\\r\\nhis mind, and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her to\\r\\nresolve on. Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of the\\r\\nopen weather, but her answers were as short and indifferent as civility\\r\\nallowed. She could not wish him to stay, and would much rather not have\\r\\nhim speak to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her thoughts on\\r\\nseeing him; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _his_ spirits.\\r\\nHere he was again on the same ground where all had passed before, and\\r\\napparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams,\\r\\nas if he had never known Mansfield in any other state. She heard them\\r\\nspoken of by him only in a general way, till they were all re-assembled\\r\\nin the drawing-room, when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter of\\r\\nbusiness with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them, and\\r\\nMrs. Grant occupied at the tea-table, he began talking of them with more\\r\\nparticularity to his other sister. With a significant smile, which made\\r\\nFanny quite hate him, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo! Rushworth and his fair bride are at\\r\\nBrighton, I understand; happy man!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, they have been there about a fortnight, Miss Price, have they not?\\r\\nAnd Julia is with them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd Mr. Yates, I presume, is not far off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Yates! Oh! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates. I do not imagine he\\r\\nfigures much in the letters to Mansfield Park; do you, Miss Price? I\\r\\nthink my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr.\\r\\nYates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Rushworth and his two-and-forty speeches!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Crawford.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody can ever forget them. Poor fellow! I see him now--his toil and\\r\\nhis despair. Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want\\r\\nhim to make two-and-forty speeches to her\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; adding, with a momentary\\r\\nseriousness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is too good for him--much too good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And then changing\\r\\nhis tone again to one of gentle gallantry, and addressing Fanny, he\\r\\nsaid, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were Mr. Rushworth's best friend. Your kindness and patience\\r\\ncan never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience in trying to make it\\r\\npossible for him to learn his part--in trying to give him a brain\\r\\nwhich nature had denied--to mix up an understanding for him out of the\\r\\nsuperfluity of your own! _He_ might not have sense enough himself to\\r\\nestimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it had honour from\\r\\nall the rest of the party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny coloured, and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is as a dream, a pleasant dream!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed, breaking forth\\r\\nagain, after a few minutes' musing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall always look back on our\\r\\ntheatricals with exquisite pleasure. There was such an interest, such an\\r\\nanimation, such a spirit diffused. Everybody felt it. We were all alive.\\r\\nThere was employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every hour of\\r\\nthe day. Always some little objection, some little doubt, some little\\r\\nanxiety to be got over. I never was happier.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever\\r\\nhappier!--never happier than when doing what you must know was not\\r\\njustifiable!--never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and\\r\\nunfeelingly! Oh! what a corrupted mind!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were unlucky, Miss Price,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, in a lower tone, to avoid\\r\\nthe possibility of being heard by Edmund, and not at all aware of her\\r\\nfeelings, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe certainly were very unlucky. Another week, only one other\\r\\nweek, would have been enough for us. I think if we had had the disposal\\r\\nof events--if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds\\r\\njust for a week or two, about the equinox, there would have been\\r\\na difference. Not that we would have endangered his safety by any\\r\\ntremendous weather--but only by a steady contrary wind, or a calm. I\\r\\nthink, Miss Price, we would have indulged ourselves with a week's calm\\r\\nin the Atlantic at that season.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny, averting her face, said,\\r\\nwith a firmer tone than usual, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs far as _I_ am concerned, sir, I would\\r\\nnot have delayed his return for a day. My uncle disapproved it all so\\r\\nentirely when he did arrive, that in my opinion everything had gone\\r\\nquite far enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before, and\\r\\nnever so angrily to any one; and when her speech was over, she trembled\\r\\nand blushed at her own daring. He was surprised; but after a few\\r\\nmoments' silent consideration of her, replied in a calmer, graver tone,\\r\\nand as if the candid result of conviction, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe you are right.\\r\\nIt was more pleasant than prudent. We were getting too noisy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And\\r\\nthen turning the conversation, he would have engaged her on some other\\r\\nsubject, but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not\\r\\nadvance in any.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund,\\r\\nnow observed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose gentlemen must have some very interesting point to\\r\\ndiscuss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe most interesting in the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied her brother--\\xe2\\x80\\x9chow to make\\r\\nmoney; how to turn a good income into a better. Dr. Grant is giving\\r\\nBertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon. I find\\r\\nhe takes orders in a few weeks. They were at it in the dining-parlour. I\\r\\nam glad to hear Bertram will be so well off. He will have a very pretty\\r\\nincome to make ducks and drakes with, and earned without much trouble. I\\r\\napprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year. Seven hundred\\r\\na year is a fine thing for a younger brother; and as of course he will\\r\\nstill live at home, it will be all for his _menus_ _plaisirs_; and a\\r\\nsermon at Christmas and Easter, I suppose, will be the sum total of\\r\\nsacrifice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing amuses me\\r\\nmore than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of\\r\\nthose who have a great deal less than themselves. You would look rather\\r\\nblank, Henry, if your _menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to seven\\r\\nhundred a year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is entirely comparative.\\r\\nBirthright and habit must settle the business. Bertram is certainly well\\r\\noff for a cadet of even a baronet's family. By the time he is four or\\r\\nfive and twenty he will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do for\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford _could_ have said that there would be a something to do\\r\\nand to suffer for it, which she could not think lightly of; but she\\r\\nchecked herself and let it pass; and tried to look calm and unconcerned\\r\\nwhen the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBertram,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Henry Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall make a point of coming to\\r\\nMansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purpose\\r\\nto encourage a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will not\\r\\nyou join me in encouraging your cousin? Will not you engage to attend\\r\\nwith your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time--as I shall do--not\\r\\nto lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentence\\r\\npreeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a\\r\\npencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that\\r\\nSir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more\\r\\nsorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill he not feel this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Fanny. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, he can feel nothing as he\\r\\nought.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party being now all united, and the chief talkers attracting each\\r\\nother, she remained in tranquillity; and as a whist-table was formed\\r\\nafter tea--formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his\\r\\nattentive wife, though it was not to be supposed so--and Miss Crawford\\r\\ntook her harp, she had nothing to do but to listen; and her tranquillity\\r\\nremained undisturbed the rest of the evening, except when Mr. Crawford\\r\\nnow and then addressed to her a question or observation, which she could\\r\\nnot avoid answering. Miss Crawford was too much vexed by what had passed\\r\\nto be in a humour for anything but music. With that she soothed herself\\r\\nand amused her friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assurance of Edmund's being so soon to take orders, coming upon her\\r\\nlike a blow that had been suspended, and still hoped uncertain and at a\\r\\ndistance, was felt with resentment and mortification. She was very angry\\r\\nwith him. She had thought her influence more. She _had_ begun to think\\r\\nof him; she felt that she had, with great regard, with almost decided\\r\\nintentions; but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings. It\\r\\nwas plain that he could have no serious views, no true attachment, by\\r\\nfixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never\\r\\nstoop to. She would learn to match him in his indifference. She would\\r\\nhenceforth admit his attentions without any idea beyond immediate\\r\\namusement. If _he_ could so command his affections, _hers_ should do her\\r\\nno harm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Crawford had quite made up his mind by the next morning to give\\r\\nanother fortnight to Mansfield, and having sent for his hunters, and\\r\\nwritten a few lines of explanation to the Admiral, he looked round at\\r\\nhis sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him, and seeing the\\r\\ncoast clear of the rest of the family, said, with a smile, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd how do\\r\\nyou think I mean to amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt?\\r\\nI am grown too old to go out more than three times a week; but I have a\\r\\nplan for the intermediate days, and what do you think it is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo walk and ride with me, to be sure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot exactly, though I shall be happy to do both, but _that_ would be\\r\\nexercise only to my body, and I must take care of my mind. Besides,\\r\\n_that_ would be all recreation and indulgence, without the wholesome\\r\\nalloy of labour, and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness. No, my\\r\\nplan is to make Fanny Price in love with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny Price! Nonsense! No, no. You ought to be satisfied with her two\\r\\ncousins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a small\\r\\nhole in Fanny Price's heart. You do not seem properly aware of her\\r\\nclaims to notice. When we talked of her last night, you none of you\\r\\nseemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her\\r\\nlooks within the last six weeks. You see her every day, and therefore do\\r\\nnot notice it; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from\\r\\nwhat she was in the autumn. She was then merely a quiet, modest, not\\r\\nplain-looking girl, but she is now absolutely pretty. I used to think\\r\\nshe had neither complexion nor countenance; but in that soft skin of\\r\\nhers, so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday, there is\\r\\ndecided beauty; and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth, I do\\r\\nnot despair of their being capable of expression enough when she\\r\\nhas anything to express. And then, her air, her manner, her _tout_\\r\\n_ensemble_, is so indescribably improved! She must be grown two inches,\\r\\nat least, since October.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPhoo! phoo! This is only because there were no tall women to compare\\r\\nher with, and because she has got a new gown, and you never saw her so\\r\\nwell dressed before. She is just what she was in October, believe me.\\r\\nThe truth is, that she was the only girl in company for you to notice,\\r\\nand you must have a somebody. I have always thought her pretty--not\\r\\nstrikingly pretty--but 'pretty enough,' as people say; a sort of beauty\\r\\nthat grows on one. Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile;\\r\\nbut as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may all\\r\\nbe resolved into a better style of dress, and your having nobody else to\\r\\nlook at; and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation with her, you\\r\\nnever will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty, or that\\r\\nit proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer brother gave only a smile to this accusation, and soon afterwards\\r\\nsaid, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny. I do not\\r\\nunderstand her. I could not tell what she would be at yesterday. What is\\r\\nher character? Is she solemn? Is she queer? Is she prudish? Why did she\\r\\ndraw back and look so grave at me? I could hardly get her to speak. I\\r\\nnever was so long in company with a girl in my life, trying to entertain\\r\\nher, and succeed so ill! Never met with a girl who looked so grave on\\r\\nme! I must try to get the better of this. Her looks say, 'I will not\\r\\nlike you, I am determined not to like you'; and I say she shall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFoolish fellow! And so this is her attraction after all! This it is,\\r\\nher not caring about you, which gives her such a soft skin, and makes\\r\\nher so much taller, and produces all these charms and graces! I do\\r\\ndesire that you will not be making her really unhappy; a _little_ love,\\r\\nperhaps, may animate and do her good, but I will not have you plunge\\r\\nher deep, for she is as good a little creature as ever lived, and has a\\r\\ngreat deal of feeling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt can be but for a fortnight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Henry; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand if a fortnight can\\r\\nkill her, she must have a constitution which nothing could save. No, I\\r\\nwill not do her any harm, dear little soul! only want her to look kindly\\r\\non me, to give me smiles as well as blushes, to keep a chair for me by\\r\\nherself wherever we are, and be all animation when I take it and talk\\r\\nto her; to think as I think, be interested in all my possessions and\\r\\npleasures, try to keep me longer at Mansfield, and feel when I go away\\r\\nthat she shall be never happy again. I want nothing more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cModeration itself!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mary. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can have no scruples now. Well, you\\r\\nwill have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself,\\r\\nfor we are a great deal together.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left Fanny to\\r\\nher fate, a fate which, had not Fanny's heart been guarded in a way\\r\\nunsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she\\r\\ndeserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young\\r\\nladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them) as are never\\r\\nto be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent,\\r\\nmanner, attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination to\\r\\nbelieve Fanny one of them, or to think that with so much tenderness\\r\\nof disposition, and so much taste as belonged to her, she could have\\r\\nescaped heart-whole from the courtship (though the courtship only of\\r\\na fortnight) of such a man as Crawford, in spite of there being some\\r\\nprevious ill opinion of him to be overcome, had not her affection been\\r\\nengaged elsewhere. With all the security which love of another and\\r\\ndisesteem of him could give to the peace of mind he was attacking,\\r\\nhis continued attentions--continued, but not obtrusive, and adapting\\r\\nthemselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of her\\r\\ncharacter--obliged her very soon to dislike him less than formerly. She\\r\\nhad by no means forgotten the past, and she thought as ill of him as\\r\\never; but she felt his powers: he was entertaining; and his manners were\\r\\nso improved, so polite, so seriously and blamelessly polite, that it was\\r\\nimpossible not to be civil to him in return.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very few days were enough to effect this; and at the end of those few\\r\\ndays, circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his\\r\\nviews of pleasing her, inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness\\r\\nwhich must dispose her to be pleased with everybody. William, her\\r\\nbrother, the so long absent and dearly loved brother, was in England\\r\\nagain. She had a letter from him herself, a few hurried happy lines,\\r\\nwritten as the ship came up Channel, and sent into Portsmouth with\\r\\nthe first boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead; and when\\r\\nCrawford walked up with the newspaper in his hand, which he had hoped\\r\\nwould bring the first tidings, he found her trembling with joy over this\\r\\nletter, and listening with a glowing, grateful countenance to the kind\\r\\ninvitation which her uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughly\\r\\nmaster of the subject, or had in fact become at all aware of her having\\r\\nsuch a brother, or his being in such a ship, but the interest then\\r\\nexcited had been very properly lively, determining him on his return to\\r\\ntown to apply for information as to the probable period of the Antwerp's\\r\\nreturn from the Mediterranean, etc.; and the good luck which attended\\r\\nhis early examination of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of\\r\\nhis ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her, as well as\\r\\nof his dutiful attention to the Admiral, in having for many years\\r\\ntaken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence. He\\r\\nproved, however, to be too late. All those fine first feelings, of which\\r\\nhe had hoped to be the exciter, were already given. But his intention,\\r\\nthe kindness of his intention, was thankfully acknowledged: quite\\r\\nthankfully and warmly, for she was elevated beyond the common timidity\\r\\nof her mind by the flow of her love for William.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dear William would soon be amongst them. There could be no doubt\\r\\nof his obtaining leave of absence immediately, for he was still only a\\r\\nmidshipman; and as his parents, from living on the spot, must already\\r\\nhave seen him, and be seeing him perhaps daily, his direct holidays\\r\\nmight with justice be instantly given to the sister, who had been his\\r\\nbest correspondent through a period of seven years, and the uncle who\\r\\nhad done most for his support and advancement; and accordingly the reply\\r\\nto her reply, fixing a very early day for his arrival, came as soon as\\r\\npossible; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in\\r\\nthe agitation of her first dinner-visit, when she found herself in an\\r\\nagitation of a higher nature, watching in the hall, in the lobby, on\\r\\nthe stairs, for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her a\\r\\nbrother.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came happily while she was thus waiting; and there being neither\\r\\nceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting, she was with\\r\\nhim as he entered the house, and the first minutes of exquisite feeling\\r\\nhad no interruption and no witnesses, unless the servants chiefly intent\\r\\nupon opening the proper doors could be called such. This was exactly\\r\\nwhat Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at, as each\\r\\nproved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both\\r\\nadvised Mrs. Norris's continuing where she was, instead of rushing out\\r\\ninto the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam and Fanny soon shewed themselves; and Sir Thomas had the\\r\\npleasure of receiving, in his protege, certainly a very different person\\r\\nfrom the one he had equipped seven years ago, but a young man of an\\r\\nopen, pleasant countenance, and frank, unstudied, but feeling and\\r\\nrespectful manners, and such as confirmed him his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of\\r\\nsuch an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation,\\r\\nand the first of fruition; it was some time even before her happiness\\r\\ncould be said to make her happy, before the disappointment inseparable\\r\\nfrom the alteration of person had vanished, and she could see in him the\\r\\nsame William as before, and talk to him, as her heart had been yearning\\r\\nto do through many a past year. That time, however, did gradually come,\\r\\nforwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her own, and much less\\r\\nencumbered by refinement or self-distrust. She was the first object\\r\\nof his love, but it was a love which his stronger spirits, and bolder\\r\\ntemper, made it as natural for him to express as to feel. On the\\r\\nmorrow they were walking about together with true enjoyment, and every\\r\\nsucceeding morrow renewed a _tete-a-tete_ which Sir Thomas could not but\\r\\nobserve with complacency, even before Edmund had pointed it out to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or\\r\\nunlooked-for instance of Edmund's consideration of her in the last few\\r\\nmonths had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life,\\r\\nas in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and\\r\\nfriend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes\\r\\nand fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,\\r\\ndearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give\\r\\nher direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers and\\r\\nsisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all the\\r\\ncomforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield; ready to\\r\\nthink of every member of that home as she directed, or differing only\\r\\nby a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of their aunt Norris,\\r\\nand with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the whole) all the evil\\r\\nand good of their earliest years could be gone over again, and every\\r\\nformer united pain and pleasure retraced with the fondest recollection.\\r\\nAn advantage this, a strengthener of love, in which even the conjugal\\r\\ntie is beneath the fraternal. Children of the same family, the same\\r\\nblood, with the same first associations and habits, have some means of\\r\\nenjoyment in their power, which no subsequent connexions can supply; and\\r\\nit must be by a long and unnatural estrangement, by a divorce which\\r\\nno subsequent connexion can justify, if such precious remains of the\\r\\nearliest attachments are ever entirely outlived. Too often, alas! it is\\r\\nso. Fraternal love, sometimes almost everything, is at others worse than\\r\\nnothing. But with William and Fanny Price it was still a sentiment\\r\\nin all its prime and freshness, wounded by no opposition of interest,\\r\\ncooled by no separate attachment, and feeling the influence of time and\\r\\nabsence only in its increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who had\\r\\nhearts to value anything good. Henry Crawford was as much struck with\\r\\nit as any. He honoured the warm-hearted, blunt fondness of the young\\r\\nsailor, which led him to say, with his hands stretched towards Fanny's\\r\\nhead, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you know, I begin to like that queer fashion already, though\\r\\nwhen I first heard of such things being done in England, I could\\r\\nnot believe it; and when Mrs. Brown, and the other women at the\\r\\nCommissioner's at Gibraltar, appeared in the same trim, I thought they\\r\\nwere mad; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and saw, with lively\\r\\nadmiration, the glow of Fanny's cheek, the brightness of her eye, the\\r\\ndeep interest, the absorbed attention, while her brother was describing\\r\\nany of the imminent hazards, or terrific scenes, which such a period at\\r\\nsea must supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a picture which Henry Crawford had moral taste enough to value.\\r\\nFanny's attractions increased--increased twofold; for the sensibility\\r\\nwhich beautified her complexion and illumined her countenance was an\\r\\nattraction in itself. He was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of\\r\\nher heart. She had feeling, genuine feeling. It would be something to\\r\\nbe loved by such a girl, to excite the first ardours of her young\\r\\nunsophisticated mind! She interested him more than he had foreseen. A\\r\\nfortnight was not enough. His stay became indefinite.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam was often called on by his uncle to be the talker. His recitals\\r\\nwere amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas, but the chief object in\\r\\nseeking them was to understand the reciter, to know the young man by his\\r\\nhistories; and he listened to his clear, simple, spirited details\\r\\nwith full satisfaction, seeing in them the proof of good principles,\\r\\nprofessional knowledge, energy, courage, and cheerfulness, everything\\r\\nthat could deserve or promise well. Young as he was, William had already\\r\\nseen a great deal. He had been in the Mediterranean; in the West Indies;\\r\\nin the Mediterranean again; had been often taken on shore by the favour\\r\\nof his captain, and in the course of seven years had known every variety\\r\\nof danger which sea and war together could offer. With such means in\\r\\nhis power he had a right to be listened to; and though Mrs. Norris could\\r\\nfidget about the room, and disturb everybody in quest of two needlefuls\\r\\nof thread or a second-hand shirt button, in the midst of her nephew's\\r\\naccount of a shipwreck or an engagement, everybody else was attentive;\\r\\nand even Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved, or\\r\\nwithout sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear me! how\\r\\ndisagreeable! I wonder anybody can ever go to sea.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Henry Crawford they gave a different feeling. He longed to have been\\r\\nat sea, and seen and done and suffered as much. His heart was warmed,\\r\\nhis fancy fired, and he felt the highest respect for a lad who, before\\r\\nhe was twenty, had gone through such bodily hardships and given such\\r\\nproofs of mind. The glory of heroism, of usefulness, of exertion, of\\r\\nendurance, made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful\\r\\ncontrast; and he wished he had been a William Price, distinguishing\\r\\nhimself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much\\r\\nself-respect and happy ardour, instead of what he was!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wish was rather eager than lasting. He was roused from the reverie\\r\\nof retrospection and regret produced by it, by some inquiry from Edmund\\r\\nas to his plans for the next day's hunting; and he found it was as well\\r\\nto be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command.\\r\\nIn one respect it was better, as it gave him the means of conferring a\\r\\nkindness where he wished to oblige. With spirits, courage, and curiosity\\r\\nup to anything, William expressed an inclination to hunt; and Crawford\\r\\ncould mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself, and with\\r\\nonly some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas, who knew better than his\\r\\nnephew the value of such a loan, and some alarms to reason away in\\r\\nFanny. She feared for William; by no means convinced by all that he\\r\\ncould relate of his own horsemanship in various countries, of the\\r\\nscrambling parties in which he had been engaged, the rough horses and\\r\\nmules he had ridden, or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls,\\r\\nthat he was at all equal to the management of a high-fed hunter in an\\r\\nEnglish fox-chase; nor till he returned safe and well, without accident\\r\\nor discredit, could she be reconciled to the risk, or feel any of that\\r\\nobligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he had fully\\r\\nintended it should produce. When it was proved, however, to have done\\r\\nWilliam no harm, she could allow it to be a kindness, and even reward\\r\\nthe owner with a smile when the animal was one minute tendered to his\\r\\nuse again; and the next, with the greatest cordiality, and in a manner\\r\\nnot to be resisted, made over to his use entirely so long as he remained\\r\\nin Northamptonshire.\\r\\n\\r\\n                        [End volume one of this edition.\\r\\n                        Printed by T. and A. Constable,\\r\\n                        Printers to Her Majesty at\\r\\n                        the Edinburgh University Press]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intercourse of the two families was at this period more nearly\\r\\nrestored to what it had been in the autumn, than any member of the\\r\\nold intimacy had thought ever likely to be again. The return of Henry\\r\\nCrawford, and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it,\\r\\nbut much was still owing to Sir Thomas's more than toleration of the\\r\\nneighbourly attempts at the Parsonage. His mind, now disengaged from\\r\\nthe cares which had pressed on him at first, was at leisure to find\\r\\nthe Grants and their young inmates really worth visiting; and though\\r\\ninfinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous\\r\\nmatrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent possibilities\\r\\nof any one most dear to him, and disdaining even as a littleness the\\r\\nbeing quick-sighted on such points, he could not avoid perceiving, in\\r\\na grand and careless way, that Mr. Crawford was somewhat distinguishing\\r\\nhis niece--nor perhaps refrain (though unconsciously) from giving a more\\r\\nwilling assent to invitations on that account.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage, when the\\r\\ngeneral invitation was at last hazarded, after many debates and many\\r\\ndoubts as to whether it were worth while, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause Sir Thomas seemed\\r\\nso ill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d proceeded from\\r\\ngood-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr.\\r\\nCrawford, but as being one in an agreeable group: for it was in the\\r\\ncourse of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in\\r\\nthe habit of such idle observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr.\\r\\nCrawford was the admirer of Fanny Price.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one, being composed in a\\r\\ngood proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen;\\r\\nand the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful, according to the usual\\r\\nstyle of the Grants, and too much according to the usual habits of\\r\\nall to raise any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never behold\\r\\neither the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience, and\\r\\nwho did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the\\r\\nservants behind her chair, and to bring away some fresh conviction of\\r\\nits being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening it was found, according to the predetermination of Mrs.\\r\\nGrant and her sister, that after making up the whist-table there would\\r\\nremain sufficient for a round game, and everybody being as perfectly\\r\\ncomplying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are,\\r\\nspeculation was decided on almost as soon as whist; and Lady Bertram\\r\\nsoon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for her\\r\\nown choice between the games, and being required either to draw a card\\r\\nfor whist or not. She hesitated. Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat shall I do, Sir Thomas? Whist and speculation; which will amuse me\\r\\nmost?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas, after a moment's thought, recommended speculation. He was\\r\\na whist player himself, and perhaps might feel that it would not much\\r\\namuse him to have her for a partner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was her ladyship's contented answer; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen speculation, if\\r\\nyou please, Mrs. Grant. I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach\\r\\nme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her own\\r\\nequal ignorance; she had never played the game nor seen it played in\\r\\nher life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment's indecision again; but upon\\r\\neverybody's assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it was the\\r\\neasiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford's stepping forward with a\\r\\nmost earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss\\r\\nPrice, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.\\r\\nNorris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime\\r\\nintellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss Crawford's\\r\\ndirection, were arranged round the other. It was a fine arrangement\\r\\nfor Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his hands full of\\r\\nbusiness, having two persons' cards to manage as well as his own; for\\r\\nthough it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of the\\r\\nrules of the game in three minutes, he had yet to inspirit her play,\\r\\nsharpen her avarice, and harden her heart, which, especially in any\\r\\ncompetition with William, was a work of some difficulty; and as for Lady\\r\\nBertram, he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune through\\r\\nthe whole evening; and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her\\r\\ncards when the deal began, must direct her in whatever was to be done\\r\\nwith them to the end of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in high spirits, doing everything with happy ease, and preeminent\\r\\nin all the lively turns, quick resources, and playful impudence that\\r\\ncould do honour to the game; and the round table was altogether a very\\r\\ncomfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and orderly silence of the\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his\\r\\nlady, but in vain; no pause was long enough for the time his measured\\r\\nmanner needed; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs.\\r\\nGrant was able, at the end of the first rubber, to go to her and pay her\\r\\ncompliments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope your ladyship is pleased with the game.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear, yes! very entertaining indeed. A very odd game. I do not know\\r\\nwhat it is all about. I am never to see my cards; and Mr. Crawford does\\r\\nall the rest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBertram,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the opportunity\\r\\nof a little languor in the game, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have never told you what happened to\\r\\nme yesterday in my ride home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They had been hunting together, and were\\r\\nin the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield, when\\r\\nhis horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had been\\r\\nobliged to give up, and make the best of his way back. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told you I\\r\\nlost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees, because\\r\\nI can never bear to ask; but I have not told you that, with my usual\\r\\nluck--for I never do wrong without gaining by it--I found myself in due\\r\\ntime in the very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was suddenly,\\r\\nupon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the midst of\\r\\na retired little village between gently rising hills; a small stream\\r\\nbefore me to be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to my\\r\\nright--which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place, and\\r\\nnot a gentleman or half a gentleman's house to be seen excepting one--to\\r\\nbe presumed the Parsonage--within a stone's throw of the said knoll and\\r\\nchurch. I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt sounds like it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut which way did you turn after\\r\\npassing Sewell's farm?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions; though were I to\\r\\nanswer all that you could put in the course of an hour, you would never\\r\\nbe able to prove that it was _not_ Thornton Lacey--for such it certainly\\r\\nwas.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou inquired, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I never inquire. But I _told_ a man mending a hedge that it was\\r\\nThornton Lacey, and he agreed to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have a good memory. I had forgotten having ever told you half so\\r\\nmuch of the place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton Lacey was the name of his impending living, as Miss Crawford\\r\\nwell knew; and her interest in a negotiation for William Price's knave\\r\\nincreased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand how did you like what you saw?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery much indeed. You are a lucky fellow. There will be work for five\\r\\nsummers at least before the place is liveable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, not so bad as that. The farmyard must be moved, I grant you;\\r\\nbut I am not aware of anything else. The house is by no means bad, and\\r\\nwhen the yard is removed, there may be a very tolerable approach to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe farmyard must be cleared away entirely, and planted up to shut\\r\\nout the blacksmith's shop. The house must be turned to front the east\\r\\ninstead of the north--the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be\\r\\non that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may be\\r\\ndone. And _there_ must be your approach, through what is at present the\\r\\ngarden. You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house;\\r\\nwhich will be giving it the best aspect in the world, sloping to the\\r\\nsouth-east. The ground seems precisely formed for it. I rode fifty yards\\r\\nup the lane, between the church and the house, in order to look about\\r\\nme; and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The meadows\\r\\nbeyond what _will_ _be_ the garden, as well as what now _is_, sweeping\\r\\nround from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to the\\r\\nprincipal road through the village, must be all laid together, of\\r\\ncourse; very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber. They\\r\\nbelong to the living, I suppose; if not, you must purchase them. Then\\r\\nthe stream--something must be done with the stream; but I could not\\r\\nquite determine what. I had two or three ideas.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I have two or three ideas also,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand one of them is,\\r\\nthat very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in\\r\\npractice. I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty. I\\r\\nthink the house and premises may be made comfortable, and given the air\\r\\nof a gentleman's residence, without any very heavy expense, and that\\r\\nmust suffice me; and, I hope, may suffice all who care about me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone of\\r\\nvoice, and a certain half-look attending the last expression of his\\r\\nhope, made a hasty finish of her dealings with William Price; and\\r\\nsecuring his knave at an exorbitant rate, exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere, I will\\r\\nstake my last like a woman of spirit. No cold prudence for me. I am not\\r\\nborn to sit still and do nothing. If I lose the game, it shall not be\\r\\nfrom not striving for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game was hers, and only did not pay her for what she had given\\r\\nto secure it. Another deal proceeded, and Crawford began again about\\r\\nThornton Lacey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy plan may not be the best possible: I had not many minutes to form\\r\\nit in; but you must do a good deal. The place deserves it, and you\\r\\nwill find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of.\\r\\n(Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie\\r\\njust before you.) The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving it\\r\\nthe air of a gentleman's residence. _That_ will be done by the removal\\r\\nof the farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never saw\\r\\na house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a\\r\\ngentleman's residence, so much the look of a something above a mere\\r\\nparsonage-house--above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is\\r\\nnot a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs\\r\\nas windows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square\\r\\nfarmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as\\r\\none might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from\\r\\ngeneration to generation, through two centuries at least, and were now\\r\\nspending from two to three thousand a year in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Miss Crawford listened,\\r\\nand Edmund agreed to this. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe air of a gentleman's residence,\\r\\ntherefore, you cannot but give it, if you do anything. But it is capable\\r\\nof much more. (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that\\r\\nqueen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram does not\\r\\nbid a dozen. She will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By some\\r\\nsuch improvements as I have suggested (I do not really require you to\\r\\nproceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody's striking out\\r\\na better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it into\\r\\na _place_. From being the mere gentleman's residence, it becomes, by\\r\\njudicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste,\\r\\nmodern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and that\\r\\nhouse receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the\\r\\ngreat landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road;\\r\\nespecially as there is no real squire's house to dispute the point--a\\r\\ncircumstance, between ourselves, to enhance the value of such a\\r\\nsituation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation.\\r\\n_You_ think with me, I hope\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (turning with a softened voice to Fanny).\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you ever seen the place?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny gave a quick negative, and tried to hide her interest in the\\r\\nsubject by an eager attention to her brother, who was driving as hard a\\r\\nbargain, and imposing on her as much as he could; but Crawford pursued\\r\\nwith \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, you must not part with the queen. You have bought her too\\r\\ndearly, and your brother does not offer half her value. No, no, sir,\\r\\nhands off, hands off. Your sister does not part with the queen. She is\\r\\nquite determined. The game will be yours,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d turning to her again; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\r\\nwill certainly be yours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd Fanny had much rather it were William's,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, smiling at\\r\\nher. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Fanny! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Bertram,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou know\\r\\nHenry to be such a capital improver, that you cannot possibly engage in\\r\\nanything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help. Only\\r\\nthink how useful he was at Sotherton! Only think what grand things were\\r\\nproduced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to drive\\r\\nabout the grounds, and see his genius take fire. There we went, and\\r\\nthere we came home again; and what was done there is not to be told!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment with an expression\\r\\nmore than grave--even reproachful; but on catching his, were instantly\\r\\nwithdrawn. With something of consciousness he shook his head at his\\r\\nsister, and laughingly replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot say there was much done at\\r\\nSotherton; but it was a hot day, and we were all walking after each\\r\\nother, and bewildered.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter, he\\r\\nadded, in a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should be sorry to\\r\\nhave my powers of _planning_ judged of by the day at Sotherton. I see\\r\\nthings very differently now. Do not think of me as I appeared then.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being just then in the\\r\\nhappy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas's\\r\\ncapital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant's great hands,\\r\\nshe called out, in high good-humour, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSotherton! Yes, that is a place,\\r\\nindeed, and we had a charming day there. William, you are quite out of\\r\\nluck; but the next time you come, I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth\\r\\nwill be at home, and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly\\r\\nreceived by both. Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their\\r\\nrelations, and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man. They are at Brighton\\r\\nnow, you know; in one of the best houses there, as Mr. Rushworth's fine\\r\\nfortune gives them a right to be. I do not exactly know the distance,\\r\\nbut when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not very far off, you\\r\\nought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I could send a\\r\\nlittle parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head;\\r\\nand if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a\\r\\nsmart place as that--poor scrubby midshipman as I am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might\\r\\ndepend on, when she was stopped by Sir Thomas's saying with authority,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may\\r\\nsoon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters\\r\\nwould be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr.\\r\\nRushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our\\r\\nfamily as his own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than\\r\\nanything else,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was William's only answer, in an undervoice, not meant\\r\\nto reach far, and the subject dropped.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford's\\r\\nbehaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second\\r\\nrubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last\\r\\nplay, he became a looker-on at the other, he found his niece the\\r\\nobject of attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed\\r\\ncharacter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton\\r\\nLacey; and not being able to catch Edmund's ear, was detailing it to his\\r\\nfair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness. His scheme was\\r\\nto rent the house himself the following winter, that he might have a\\r\\nhome of his own in that neighbourhood; and it was not merely for the use\\r\\nof it in the hunting-season (as he was then telling her), though _that_\\r\\nconsideration had certainly some weight, feeling as he did that, in\\r\\nspite of all Dr. Grant's very great kindness, it was impossible for him\\r\\nand his horses to be accommodated where they now were without material\\r\\ninconvenience; but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend\\r\\nupon one amusement or one season of the year: he had set his heart upon\\r\\nhaving a something there that he could come to at any time, a little\\r\\nhomestall at his command, where all the holidays of his year might be\\r\\nspent, and he might find himself continuing, improving, and _perfecting_\\r\\nthat friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park family which was\\r\\nincreasing in value to him every day. Sir Thomas heard and was not\\r\\noffended. There was no want of respect in the young man's address;\\r\\nand Fanny's reception of it was so proper and modest, so calm and\\r\\nuninviting, that he had nothing to censure in her. She said little,\\r\\nassented only here and there, and betrayed no inclination either of\\r\\nappropriating any part of the compliment to herself, or of strengthening\\r\\nhis views in favour of Northamptonshire. Finding by whom he was\\r\\nobserved, Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject to Sir\\r\\nThomas, in a more everyday tone, but still with feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have, perhaps, heard me\\r\\ntelling Miss Price. May I hope for your acquiescence, and for your not\\r\\ninfluencing your son against such a tenant?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is the only way, sir, in which\\r\\nI could _not_ wish you established as a permanent neighbour; but I hope,\\r\\nand believe, that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey.\\r\\nEdmund, am I saying too much?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on; but, on\\r\\nunderstanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence. But, Crawford, though\\r\\nI refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend. Consider the house as\\r\\nhalf your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own\\r\\nimproved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that\\r\\nmay occur to you this spring.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shall be the losers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Sir Thomas. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis going, though only\\r\\neight miles, will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle; but\\r\\nI should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile\\r\\nhimself to doing less. It is perfectly natural that you should not have\\r\\nthought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford. But a parish has wants and\\r\\nclaims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident, and\\r\\nwhich no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent. Edmund\\r\\nmight, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he might\\r\\nread prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he might ride\\r\\nover every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through divine\\r\\nservice; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day,\\r\\nfor three or four hours, if that would content him. But it will not.\\r\\nHe knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can\\r\\nconvey; and that if he does not live among his parishioners, and prove\\r\\nhimself, by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend, he does\\r\\nvery little either for their good or his own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Crawford bowed his acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI repeat again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Sir Thomas, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat Thornton Lacey is the only\\r\\nhouse in the neighbourhood in which I should _not_ be happy to wait on\\r\\nMr. Crawford as occupier.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Crawford bowed his thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cundoubtedly understands the duty of a parish\\r\\npriest. We must hope his son may prove that _he_ knows it too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever effect Sir Thomas's little harangue might really produce on Mr.\\r\\nCrawford, it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others, two\\r\\nof his most attentive listeners--Miss Crawford and Fanny. One of\\r\\nwhom, having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so\\r\\ncompletely to be his home, was pondering with downcast eyes on what it\\r\\nwould be _not_ to see Edmund every day; and the other, startled from the\\r\\nagreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength of\\r\\nher brother's description, no longer able, in the picture she had\\r\\nbeen forming of a future Thornton, to shut out the church, sink the\\r\\nclergyman, and see only the respectable, elegant, modernised, and\\r\\noccasional residence of a man of independent fortune, was considering\\r\\nSir Thomas, with decided ill-will, as the destroyer of all this, and\\r\\nsuffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his character\\r\\nand manner commanded, and from not daring to relieve herself by a single\\r\\nattempt at throwing ridicule on his cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the agreeable of _her_ speculation was over for that hour. It was\\r\\ntime to have done with cards, if sermons prevailed; and she was glad to\\r\\nfind it necessary to come to a conclusion, and be able to refresh her\\r\\nspirits by a change of place and neighbour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief of the party were now collected irregularly round the\\r\\nfire, and waiting the final break-up. William and Fanny were the most\\r\\ndetached. They remained together at the otherwise deserted card-table,\\r\\ntalking very comfortably, and not thinking of the rest, till some of the\\r\\nrest began to think of them. Henry Crawford's chair was the first to be\\r\\ngiven a direction towards them, and he sat silently observing them for a\\r\\nfew minutes; himself, in the meanwhile, observed by Sir Thomas, who was\\r\\nstanding in chat with Dr. Grant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the assembly night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I were at Portsmouth I\\r\\nshould be at it, perhaps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, Fanny, that I do not. I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of\\r\\ndancing too, when I cannot have you. And I do not know that there would\\r\\nbe any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner.\\r\\nThe Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a\\r\\ncommission. One might as well be nothing as a midshipman. One _is_\\r\\nnothing, indeed. You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazing\\r\\nfine girls, but they will hardly speak to _me_, because Lucy is courted\\r\\nby a lieutenant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! shame, shame! But never mind it, William\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (her own cheeks in a\\r\\nglow of indignation as she spoke). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not worth minding. It is no\\r\\nreflection on _you_; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have\\r\\nall experienced, more or less, in their time. You must think of that,\\r\\nyou must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which\\r\\nfall to every sailor's share, like bad weather and hard living, only\\r\\nwith this advantage, that there will be an end to it, that there will\\r\\ncome a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure. When you\\r\\nare a lieutenant! only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, how\\r\\nlittle you will care for any nonsense of this kind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny. Everybody gets\\r\\nmade but me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding. My uncle\\r\\nsays nothing, but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get\\r\\nyou made. He knows, as well as you do, of what consequence it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was checked by the sight of her uncle much nearer to them than she\\r\\nhad any suspicion of, and each found it necessary to talk of something\\r\\nelse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you fond of dancing, Fanny?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very; only I am soon tired.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance. Have you\\r\\nnever any balls at Northampton? I should like to see you dance, and I'd\\r\\ndance with you if you _would_, for nobody would know who I was here,\\r\\nand I should like to be your partner once more. We used to jump about\\r\\ntogether many a time, did not we? when the hand-organ was in the street?\\r\\nI am a pretty good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n And turning to his uncle, who was now close to them, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs not Fanny a\\r\\nvery good dancer, sir?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, in dismay at such an unprecedented question, did not know which\\r\\nway to look, or how to be prepared for the answer. Some very grave\\r\\nreproof, or at least the coldest expression of indifference, must be\\r\\ncoming to distress her brother, and sink her to the ground. But, on the\\r\\ncontrary, it was no worse than, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry to say that I am unable\\r\\nto answer your question. I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a\\r\\nlittle girl; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like\\r\\na gentlewoman when we do see her, which, perhaps, we may have an\\r\\nopportunity of doing ere long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance, Mr. Price,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Henry Crawford, leaning forward, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand will engage to answer every\\r\\ninquiry which you can make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction.\\r\\nBut I believe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (seeing Fanny looked distressed) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit must be at some\\r\\nother time. There is _one_ person in company who does not like to have\\r\\nMiss Price spoken of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue enough, he had once seen Fanny dance; and it was equally true\\r\\nthat he would now have answered for her gliding about with quiet, light\\r\\nelegance, and in admirable time; but, in fact, he could not for the life\\r\\nof him recall what her dancing had been, and rather took it for granted\\r\\nthat she had been present than remembered anything about her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe passed, however, for an admirer of her dancing; and Sir Thomas, by no\\r\\nmeans displeased, prolonged the conversation on dancing in general, and\\r\\nwas so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and listening to\\r\\nwhat his nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing which\\r\\nhad fallen within his observation, that he had not heard his carriage\\r\\nannounced, and was first called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of\\r\\nMrs. Norris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about? We are going. Do not you see\\r\\nyour aunt is going? Quick, quick! I cannot bear to keep good old Wilcox\\r\\nwaiting. You should always remember the coachman and horses. My dear Sir\\r\\nThomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you,\\r\\nand Edmund and William.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his own arrangement,\\r\\npreviously communicated to his wife and sister; but _that_ seemed\\r\\nforgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she settled it all\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawl\\r\\nwhich Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round\\r\\nher shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford's quicker hand, and she was\\r\\nobliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam's desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary\\r\\nimpression on his uncle. The hope of an opportunity, which Sir Thomas\\r\\nhad then given, was not given to be thought of no more. He remained\\r\\nsteadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybody\\r\\nelse who might wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the\\r\\nyoung people in general; and having thought the matter over, and taken\\r\\nhis resolution in quiet independence, the result of it appeared the\\r\\nnext morning at breakfast, when, after recalling and commending what\\r\\nhis nephew had said, he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not like, William, that you\\r\\nshould leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence. It would give me\\r\\npleasure to see you both dance. You spoke of the balls at Northampton.\\r\\nYour cousins have occasionally attended them; but they would not\\r\\naltogether suit us now. The fatigue would be too much for your aunt. I\\r\\nbelieve we must not think of a Northampton ball. A dance at home would\\r\\nbe more eligible; and if--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, my dear Sir Thomas!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interrupted Mrs. Norris, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew what was\\r\\ncoming. I knew what you were going to say. If dear Julia were at home,\\r\\nor dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton, to afford a reason, an occasion\\r\\nfor such a thing, you would be tempted to give the young people a dance\\r\\nat Mansfield. I know you would. If _they_ were at home to grace the\\r\\nball, a ball you would have this very Christmas. Thank your uncle,\\r\\nWilliam, thank your uncle!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy daughters,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Sir Thomas, gravely interposing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave their\\r\\npleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy; but the dance which I\\r\\nthink of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins. Could we be all\\r\\nassembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete, but the\\r\\nabsence of some is not to debar the others of amusement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris had not another word to say. She saw decision in his looks,\\r\\nand her surprise and vexation required some minutes' silence to be\\r\\nsettled into composure. A ball at such a time! His daughters absent and\\r\\nherself not consulted! There was comfort, however, soon at hand. _She_\\r\\nmust be the doer of everything: Lady Bertram would of course be spared\\r\\nall thought and exertion, and it would all fall upon _her_. She should\\r\\nhave to do the honours of the evening; and this reflection quickly\\r\\nrestored so much of her good-humour as enabled her to join in with the\\r\\nothers, before their happiness and thanks were all expressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speak\\r\\nas much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could\\r\\ndesire. Edmund's feelings were for the other two. His father had never\\r\\nconferred a favour or shewn a kindness more to his satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented, and had no\\r\\nobjections to make. Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little\\r\\ntrouble; and she assured him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat she was not at all afraid of the\\r\\ntrouble; indeed, she could not imagine there would be any.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he would\\r\\nthink fittest to be used, but found it all prearranged; and when she\\r\\nwould have conjectured and hinted about the day, it appeared that the\\r\\nday was settled too. Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a\\r\\nvery complete outline of the business; and as soon as she would listen\\r\\nquietly, could read his list of the families to be invited, from whom\\r\\nhe calculated, with all necessary allowance for the shortness of the\\r\\nnotice, to collect young people enough to form twelve or fourteen\\r\\ncouple: and could detail the considerations which had induced him to\\r\\nfix on the 22nd as the most eligible day. William was required to be at\\r\\nPortsmouth on the 24th; the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his\\r\\nvisit; but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any\\r\\nearlier. Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the\\r\\nsame, and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself,\\r\\nas by far the best day for the purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening a proclaimed\\r\\nthing to all whom it concerned. Invitations were sent with despatch,\\r\\nand many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of happy\\r\\ncares as well as Fanny. To her the cares were sometimes almost beyond\\r\\nthe happiness; for young and inexperienced, with small means of choice\\r\\nand no confidence in her own taste, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow she should be dressed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was\\r\\na point of painful solicitude; and the almost solitary ornament in her\\r\\npossession, a very pretty amber cross which William had brought her from\\r\\nSicily, was the greatest distress of all, for she had nothing but a bit\\r\\nof ribbon to fasten it to; and though she had worn it in that manner\\r\\nonce, would it be allowable at such a time in the midst of all the rich\\r\\nornaments which she supposed all the other young ladies would appear in?\\r\\nAnd yet not to wear it! William had wanted to buy her a gold chain too,\\r\\nbut the purchase had been beyond his means, and therefore not to wear\\r\\nthe cross might be mortifying him. These were anxious considerations;\\r\\nenough to sober her spirits even under the prospect of a ball given\\r\\nprincipally for her gratification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preparations meanwhile went on, and Lady Bertram continued to sit on\\r\\nher sofa without any inconvenience from them. She had some extra visits\\r\\nfrom the housekeeper, and her maid was rather hurried in making up a new\\r\\ndress for her: Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran about; but\\r\\nall this gave _her_ no trouble, and as she had foreseen, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere was, in\\r\\nfact, no trouble in the business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his mind being\\r\\ndeeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now\\r\\nat hand, which were to fix his fate in life--ordination and\\r\\nmatrimony--events of such a serious character as to make the ball, which\\r\\nwould be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in\\r\\nhis eyes than in those of any other person in the house. On the 23rd\\r\\nhe was going to a friend near Peterborough, in the same situation\\r\\nas himself, and they were to receive ordination in the course of the\\r\\nChristmas week. Half his destiny would then be determined, but the\\r\\nother half might not be so very smoothly wooed. His duties would be\\r\\nestablished, but the wife who was to share, and animate, and reward\\r\\nthose duties, might yet be unattainable. He knew his own mind, but he\\r\\nwas not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford's. There were\\r\\npoints on which they did not quite agree; there were moments in which\\r\\nshe did not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to her\\r\\naffection, so far as to be resolved--almost resolved--on bringing it to\\r\\na decision within a very short time, as soon as the variety of business\\r\\nbefore him were arranged, and he knew what he had to offer her, he\\r\\nhad many anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result. His\\r\\nconviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong; he could\\r\\nlook back on a long course of encouragement, and she was as perfect in\\r\\ndisinterested attachment as in everything else. But at other times\\r\\ndoubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought of\\r\\nher acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement, her decided\\r\\npreference of a London life, what could he expect but a determined\\r\\nrejection? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated,\\r\\ndemanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as\\r\\nconscience must forbid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of all depended on one question. Did she love him well enough\\r\\nto forego what had used to be essential points? Did she love him well\\r\\nenough to make them no longer essential? And this question, which he was\\r\\ncontinually repeating to himself, though oftenest answered with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n had sometimes its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield, and on this circumstance the\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cno\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had been very recently in alternation. He had seen\\r\\nher eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend's letter, which claimed\\r\\na long visit from her in London, and of the kindness of Henry, in\\r\\nengaging to remain where he was till January, that he might convey her\\r\\nthither; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey with\\r\\nan animation which had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in every tone. But this had occurred on the\\r\\nfirst day of its being settled, within the first hour of the burst of\\r\\nsuch enjoyment, when nothing but the friends she was to visit was before\\r\\nher. He had since heard her express herself differently, with other\\r\\nfeelings, more chequered feelings: he had heard her tell Mrs. Grant that\\r\\nshe should leave her with regret; that she began to believe neither the\\r\\nfriends nor the pleasures she was going to were worth those she left\\r\\nbehind; and that though she felt she must go, and knew she should enjoy\\r\\nherself when once away, she was already looking forward to being at\\r\\nMansfield again. Was there not a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in all this?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange, Edmund\\r\\ncould not, on his own account, think very much of the evening which the\\r\\nrest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of\\r\\nstrong interest. Independent of his two cousins' enjoyment in it, the\\r\\nevening was to him of no higher value than any other appointed meeting\\r\\nof the two families might be. In every meeting there was a hope of\\r\\nreceiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford's attachment; but the\\r\\nwhirl of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable to the\\r\\nexcitement or expression of serious feelings. To engage her early for\\r\\nthe two first dances was all the command of individual happiness which\\r\\nhe felt in his power, and the only preparation for the ball which he\\r\\ncould enter into, in spite of all that was passing around him on the\\r\\nsubject, from morning till night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still\\r\\nunable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to\\r\\nseek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and\\r\\nher sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless;\\r\\nand as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she had reason\\r\\nto think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the Parsonage\\r\\nwithout much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion;\\r\\nand the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to\\r\\nFanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own solicitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage, just setting\\r\\nout to call on her, and as it seemed to her that her friend, though\\r\\nobliged to insist on turning back, was unwilling to lose her walk, she\\r\\nexplained her business at once, and observed, that if she would be so\\r\\nkind as to give her opinion, it might be all talked over as well without\\r\\ndoors as within. Miss Crawford appeared gratified by the application,\\r\\nand after a moment's thought, urged Fanny's returning with her in a much\\r\\nmore cordial manner than before, and proposed their going up into her\\r\\nroom, where they might have a comfortable coze, without disturbing Dr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Grant, who were together in the drawing-room. It was just the\\r\\nplan to suit Fanny; and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for\\r\\nsuch ready and kind attention, they proceeded indoors, and upstairs, and\\r\\nwere soon deep in the interesting subject. Miss Crawford, pleased with\\r\\nthe appeal, gave her all her best judgment and taste, made everything\\r\\neasy by her suggestions, and tried to make everything agreeable by her\\r\\nencouragement. The dress being settled in all its grander parts--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut\\r\\nwhat shall you have by way of necklace?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall not\\r\\nyou wear your brother's cross?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And as she spoke she was undoing a\\r\\nsmall parcel, which Fanny had observed in her hand when they met. Fanny\\r\\nacknowledged her wishes and doubts on this point: she did not know\\r\\nhow either to wear the cross, or to refrain from wearing it. She was\\r\\nanswered by having a small trinket-box placed before her, and being\\r\\nrequested to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces. Such\\r\\nhad been the parcel with which Miss Crawford was provided, and such the\\r\\nobject of her intended visit: and in the kindest manner she now urged\\r\\nFanny's taking one for the cross and to keep for her sake, saying\\r\\neverything she could think of to obviate the scruples which were making\\r\\nFanny start back at first with a look of horror at the proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see what a collection I have,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmore by half than I ever\\r\\nuse or think of. I do not offer them as new. I offer nothing but an old\\r\\nnecklace. You must forgive the liberty, and oblige me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny still resisted, and from her heart. The gift was too valuable. But\\r\\nMiss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much affectionate\\r\\nearnestness through all the heads of William and the cross, and the\\r\\nball, and herself, as to be finally successful. Fanny found\\r\\nherself obliged to yield, that she might not be accused of pride\\r\\nor indifference, or some other littleness; and having with modest\\r\\nreluctance given her consent, proceeded to make the selection. She\\r\\nlooked and looked, longing to know which might be least valuable; and\\r\\nwas determined in her choice at last, by fancying there was one necklace\\r\\nmore frequently placed before her eyes than the rest. It was of gold,\\r\\nprettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a longer and a\\r\\nplainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped, in fixing\\r\\non this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep. Miss\\r\\nCrawford smiled her perfect approbation; and hastened to complete the\\r\\ngift by putting the necklace round her, and making her see how well\\r\\nit looked. Fanny had not a word to say against its becomingness, and,\\r\\nexcepting what remained of her scruples, was exceedingly pleased with\\r\\nan acquisition so very apropos. She would rather, perhaps, have been\\r\\nobliged to some other person. But this was an unworthy feeling. Miss\\r\\nCrawford had anticipated her wants with a kindness which proved her a\\r\\nreal friend. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I wear this necklace I shall always think of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand feel how very kind you were.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must think of somebody else too, when you wear that necklace,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n replied Miss Crawford. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must think of Henry, for it was his choice\\r\\nin the first place. He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over\\r\\nto you all the duty of remembering the original giver. It is to be\\r\\na family remembrancer. The sister is not to be in your mind without\\r\\nbringing the brother too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, in great astonishment and confusion, would have returned the\\r\\npresent instantly. To take what had been the gift of another person,\\r\\nof a brother too, impossible! it must not be! and with an eagerness\\r\\nand embarrassment quite diverting to her companion, she laid down the\\r\\nnecklace again on its cotton, and seemed resolved either to take another\\r\\nor none at all. Miss Crawford thought she had never seen a prettier\\r\\nconsciousness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear child,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, laughing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat are you afraid\\r\\nof? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine, and fancy you\\r\\ndid not come honestly by it? or are you imagining he would be too much\\r\\nflattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money\\r\\npurchased three years ago, before he knew there was such a throat in the\\r\\nworld? or perhaps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--looking archly--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou suspect a confederacy between\\r\\nus, and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his\\r\\ndesire?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Crawford more seriously, but without at all\\r\\nbelieving her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto convince me that you suspect no trick, and are as\\r\\nunsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you, take the necklace\\r\\nand say no more about it. Its being a gift of my brother's need not make\\r\\nthe smallest difference in your accepting it, as I assure you it makes\\r\\nnone in my willingness to part with it. He is always giving me something\\r\\nor other. I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite\\r\\nimpossible for me to value or for him to remember half. And as for this\\r\\nnecklace, I do not suppose I have worn it six times: it is very pretty,\\r\\nbut I never think of it; and though you would be most heartily welcome\\r\\nto any other in my trinket-box, you have happened to fix on the very\\r\\none which, if I have a choice, I would rather part with and see in your\\r\\npossession than any other. Say no more against it, I entreat you. Such a\\r\\ntrifle is not worth half so many words.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with renewed but less\\r\\nhappy thanks accepted the necklace again, for there was an expression in\\r\\nMiss Crawford's eyes which she could not be satisfied with.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford's change of\\r\\nmanners. She had long seen it. He evidently tried to please her: he was\\r\\ngallant, he was attentive, he was something like what he had been to her\\r\\ncousins: he wanted, she supposed, to cheat her of her tranquillity as\\r\\nhe had cheated them; and whether he might not have some concern in this\\r\\nnecklace--she could not be convinced that he had not, for Miss Crawford,\\r\\ncomplaisant as a sister, was careless as a woman and a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nReflecting and doubting, and feeling that the possession of what she had\\r\\nso much wished for did not bring much satisfaction, she now walked\\r\\nhome again, with a change rather than a diminution of cares since her\\r\\ntreading that path before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nOn reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this\\r\\nunexpected acquisition, this doubtful good of a necklace, in some\\r\\nfavourite box in the East room, which held all her smaller treasures;\\r\\nbut on opening the door, what was her surprise to find her cousin Edmund\\r\\nthere writing at the table! Such a sight having never occurred before,\\r\\nwas almost as wonderful as it was welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he directly, leaving his seat and his pen, and meeting her\\r\\nwith something in his hand, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon for being here. I came\\r\\nto look for you, and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming\\r\\nin, was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand. You will find\\r\\nthe beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now speak my business,\\r\\nwhich is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle--a chain\\r\\nfor William's cross. You ought to have had it a week ago, but there has\\r\\nbeen a delay from my brother's not being in town by several days so soon\\r\\nas I expected; and I have only just now received it at Northampton. I\\r\\nhope you will like the chain itself, Fanny. I endeavoured to consult the\\r\\nsimplicity of your taste; but, at any rate, I know you will be kind to\\r\\nmy intentions, and consider it, as it really is, a token of the love of\\r\\none of your oldest friends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, he was hurrying away, before Fanny, overpowered by a\\r\\nthousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; but\\r\\nquickened by one sovereign wish, she then called out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! cousin, stop\\r\\na moment, pray stop!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot attempt to thank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued, in a very agitated\\r\\nmanner; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthanks are out of the question. I feel much more than I can\\r\\npossibly express. Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is\\r\\nbeyond--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf that is all you have to say, Fanny\\xe2\\x80\\x9d smiling and turning away again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, it is not. I want to consult you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he had just put\\r\\ninto her hand, and seeing before her, in all the niceness of jewellers'\\r\\npacking, a plain gold chain, perfectly simple and neat, she could not\\r\\nhelp bursting forth again, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, this is beautiful indeed! This is the\\r\\nvery thing, precisely what I wished for! This is the only ornament I\\r\\nhave ever had a desire to possess. It will exactly suit my cross. They\\r\\nmust and shall be worn together. It comes, too, in such an acceptable\\r\\nmoment. Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much. I am most\\r\\nhappy that you like the chain, and that it should be here in time for\\r\\nto-morrow; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion. Believe me, I\\r\\nhave no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours.\\r\\nNo, I can safely say, I have no pleasure so complete, so unalloyed. It\\r\\nis without a drawback.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour\\r\\nwithout saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment, obliged\\r\\nher to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what\\r\\nis it that you want to consult me about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly longing to\\r\\nreturn, and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing. She gave the\\r\\nhistory of her recent visit, and now her raptures might well be over;\\r\\nfor Edmund was so struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what\\r\\nMiss Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct\\r\\nbetween them, that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one\\r\\npleasure over his own mind, though it might have its drawback. It was\\r\\nsome time before she could get his attention to her plan, or any answer\\r\\nto her demand of his opinion: he was in a reverie of fond reflection,\\r\\nuttering only now and then a few half-sentences of praise; but when\\r\\nhe did awake and understand, he was very decided in opposing what she\\r\\nwished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cReturn the necklace! No, my dear Fanny, upon no account. It would be\\r\\nmortifying her severely. There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation\\r\\nthan the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with\\r\\na reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend. Why\\r\\nshould she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it had been given to me in the first instance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nshould not have thought of returning it; but being her brother's\\r\\npresent, is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with\\r\\nit, when it is not wanted?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and its\\r\\nhaving been originally her brother's gift makes no difference; for as\\r\\nshe was not prevented from offering, nor you from taking it on that\\r\\naccount, it ought not to prevent you from keeping it. No doubt it is\\r\\nhandsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its way, and, for\\r\\nmy purpose, not half so fit. The chain will agree with William's cross\\r\\nbeyond all comparison better than the necklace.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_ a sacrifice; I am\\r\\nsure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than give\\r\\npain to one who has been so studious of your comfort. Miss Crawford's\\r\\nattentions to you have been--not more than you were justly entitled\\r\\nto--I am the last person to think that _could_ _be_, but they have been\\r\\ninvariable; and to be returning them with what must have something the\\r\\n_air_ of ingratitude, though I know it could never have the _meaning_,\\r\\nis not in your nature, I am sure. Wear the necklace, as you are engaged\\r\\nto do, to-morrow evening, and let the chain, which was not ordered with\\r\\nany reference to the ball, be kept for commoner occasions. This is my\\r\\nadvice. I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose\\r\\nintimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure, and in whose\\r\\ncharacters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity\\r\\nand natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences, resulting\\r\\nprincipally from situation, no reasonable hindrance to a perfect\\r\\nfriendship. I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nrepeated, his voice sinking a little, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbetween the two dearest objects I\\r\\nhave on earth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was gone as he spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as\\r\\nshe could. She was one of his two dearest--that must support her. But\\r\\nthe other: the first! She had never heard him speak so openly before,\\r\\nand though it told her no more than what she had long perceived, it was\\r\\na stab, for it told of his own convictions and views. They were\\r\\ndecided. He would marry Miss Crawford. It was a stab, in spite of every\\r\\nlong-standing expectation; and she was obliged to repeat again and\\r\\nagain, that she was one of his two dearest, before the words gave her\\r\\nany sensation. Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him, it would\\r\\nbe--oh, how different would it be--how far more tolerable! But he was\\r\\ndeceived in her: he gave her merits which she had not; her faults were\\r\\nwhat they had ever been, but he saw them no longer. Till she had shed\\r\\nmany tears over this deception, Fanny could not subdue her agitation;\\r\\nand the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the influence\\r\\nof fervent prayers for his happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was her intention, as she felt it to be her duty, to try to overcome\\r\\nall that was excessive, all that bordered on selfishness, in her\\r\\naffection for Edmund. To call or to fancy it a loss, a disappointment,\\r\\nwould be a presumption for which she had not words strong enough to\\r\\nsatisfy her own humility. To think of him as Miss Crawford might be\\r\\njustified in thinking, would in her be insanity. To her he could be\\r\\nnothing under any circumstances; nothing dearer than a friend. Why did\\r\\nsuch an idea occur to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden? It\\r\\nought not to have touched on the confines of her imagination. She would\\r\\nendeavour to be rational, and to deserve the right of judging of Miss\\r\\nCrawford's character, and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a\\r\\nsound intellect and an honest heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had all the heroism of principle, and was determined to do her duty;\\r\\nbut having also many of the feelings of youth and nature, let her not\\r\\nbe much wondered at, if, after making all these good resolutions on the\\r\\nside of self-government, she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund\\r\\nhad begun writing to her, as a treasure beyond all her hopes, and\\r\\nreading with the tenderest emotion these words, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy very dear Fanny,\\r\\nyou must do me the favour to accept\\xe2\\x80\\x9d locked it up with the chain, as the\\r\\ndearest part of the gift. It was the only thing approaching to a letter\\r\\nwhich she had ever received from him; she might never receive another;\\r\\nit was impossible that she ever should receive another so perfectly\\r\\ngratifying in the occasion and the style. Two lines more prized had\\r\\nnever fallen from the pen of the most distinguished author--never\\r\\nmore completely blessed the researches of the fondest biographer. The\\r\\nenthusiasm of a woman's love is even beyond the biographer's. To her,\\r\\nthe handwriting itself, independent of anything it may convey, is a\\r\\nblessedness. Never were such characters cut by any other human being as\\r\\nEdmund's commonest handwriting gave! This specimen, written in haste\\r\\nas it was, had not a fault; and there was a felicity in the flow of the\\r\\nfirst four words, in the arrangement of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy very dear Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which she\\r\\ncould have looked at for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happy\\r\\nmixture of reason and weakness, she was able in due time to go down\\r\\nand resume her usual employments near her aunt Bertram, and pay her the\\r\\nusual observances without any apparent want of spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened with\\r\\nmore kindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days often\\r\\nvolunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought\\r\\nfrom Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he found himself obliged\\r\\nto go to London on the morrow for a few days, he could not help trying\\r\\nto procure a companion; and therefore hoped that if William could\\r\\nmake up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been\\r\\nproposed, he would accept a place in his carriage. Mr. Crawford meant to\\r\\nbe in town by his uncle's accustomary late dinner-hour, and William\\r\\nwas invited to dine with him at the Admiral's. The proposal was a very\\r\\npleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling post\\r\\nwith four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and, in\\r\\nlikening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once everything\\r\\nin favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could\\r\\nsuggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly pleased;\\r\\nfor the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from\\r\\nNorthampton the following night, which would not have allowed him an\\r\\nhour's rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and though\\r\\nthis offer of Mr. Crawford's would rob her of many hours of his company,\\r\\nshe was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such\\r\\na journey, to think of anything else. Sir Thomas approved of it for\\r\\nanother reason. His nephew's introduction to Admiral Crawford might be\\r\\nof service. The Admiral, he believed, had interest. Upon the whole, it\\r\\nwas a very joyous note. Fanny's spirits lived on it half the morning,\\r\\nderiving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the ball, so near at hand, she had too many agitations and fears\\r\\nto have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she ought to have had,\\r\\nor must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking\\r\\nforward to the same event in situations more at ease, but under\\r\\ncircumstances of less novelty, less interest, less peculiar\\r\\ngratification, than would be attributed to her. Miss Price, known\\r\\nonly by name to half the people invited, was now to make her first\\r\\nappearance, and must be regarded as the queen of the evening. Who could\\r\\nbe happier than Miss Price? But Miss Price had not been brought up to\\r\\nthe trade of _coming_ _out_; and had she known in what light this ball\\r\\nwas, in general, considered respecting her, it would very much have\\r\\nlessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing\\r\\nwrong and being looked at. To dance without much observation or any\\r\\nextraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half the\\r\\nevening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.\\r\\nCrawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep away\\r\\nfrom her aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed to\\r\\ncomprehend her greatest possibility of happiness. As these were the best\\r\\nof her hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of a long\\r\\nmorning, spent principally with her two aunts, she was often under the\\r\\ninfluence of much less sanguine views. William, determined to make this\\r\\nlast day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting; Edmund,\\r\\nshe had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and left\\r\\nalone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because the\\r\\nhousekeeper would have her own way with the supper, and whom _she_ could\\r\\nnot avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at last to\\r\\nthink everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent off with\\r\\na parting worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her own room, and\\r\\nfelt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday; it had been\\r\\nabout the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage, and\\r\\nfound Edmund in the East room. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuppose I were to find him there again\\r\\nto-day!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a voice at that moment near her. Starting and looking up,\\r\\nshe saw, across the lobby she had just reached, Edmund himself, standing\\r\\nat the head of a different staircase. He came towards her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou look\\r\\ntired and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I have not been out at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You had\\r\\nbetter have gone out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make no answer; and\\r\\nthough he looked at her with his usual kindness, she believed he had\\r\\nsoon ceased to think of her countenance. He did not appear in spirits:\\r\\nsomething unconnected with her was probably amiss. They proceeded\\r\\nupstairs together, their rooms being on the same floor above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI come from Dr. Grant's,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund presently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may guess my\\r\\nerrand there, Fanny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And he looked so conscious, that Fanny could think\\r\\nbut of one errand, which turned her too sick for speech. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wished to\\r\\nengage Miss Crawford for the two first dances,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the explanation that\\r\\nfollowed, and brought Fanny to life again, enabling her, as she found\\r\\nshe was expected to speak, to utter something like an inquiry as to the\\r\\nresult.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe is engaged to me; but\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (with a smile that did\\r\\nnot sit easy) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe says it is to be the last time that she ever will\\r\\ndance with me. She is not serious. I think, I hope, I am sure she is\\r\\nnot serious; but I would rather not hear it. She never has danced with a\\r\\nclergyman, she says, and she never _will_. For my own sake, I could wish\\r\\nthere had been no ball just at--I mean not this very week, this very\\r\\nday; to-morrow I leave home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny struggled for speech, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very sorry that anything has\\r\\noccurred to distress you. This ought to be a day of pleasure. My uncle\\r\\nmeant it so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure. It will all end right. I\\r\\nam only vexed for a moment. In fact, it is not that I consider the ball\\r\\nas ill-timed; what does it signify? But, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stopping her, by taking\\r\\nher hand, and speaking low and seriously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou know what all this means.\\r\\nYou see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tell\\r\\nyou, how and why I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little. You are a\\r\\nkind, kind listener. I have been pained by her manner this morning, and\\r\\ncannot get the better of it. I know her disposition to be as sweet and\\r\\nfaultless as your own, but the influence of her former companions\\r\\nmakes her seem--gives to her conversation, to her professed opinions,\\r\\nsometimes a tinge of wrong. She does not _think_ evil, but she speaks\\r\\nit, speaks it in playfulness; and though I know it to be playfulness, it\\r\\ngrieves me to the soul.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe effect of education,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny gently.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund could not but agree to it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that uncle and aunt! They have\\r\\ninjured the finest mind; for sometimes, Fanny, I own to you, it does\\r\\nappear more than manner: it appears as if the mind itself was tainted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment, and therefore,\\r\\nafter a moment's consideration, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you only want me as a\\r\\nlistener, cousin, I will be as useful as I can; but I am not qualified\\r\\nfor an adviser. Do not ask advice of _me_. I am not competent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office, but you need\\r\\nnot be afraid. It is a subject on which I should never ask advice; it\\r\\nis the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked; and few,\\r\\nI imagine, do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against their\\r\\nconscience. I only want to talk to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne thing more. Excuse the liberty; but take care _how_ you talk to me.\\r\\nDo not tell me anything now, which hereafter you may be sorry for. The\\r\\ntime may come--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDearest Fanny!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Edmund, pressing her hand to his lips with\\r\\nalmost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford's, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are all\\r\\nconsiderate thought! But it is unnecessary here. The time will never\\r\\ncome. No such time as you allude to will ever come. I begin to think it\\r\\nmost improbable: the chances grow less and less; and even if it should,\\r\\nthere will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need\\r\\nbe afraid of, for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if they\\r\\nare removed, it must be by changes that will only raise her character\\r\\nthe more by the recollection of the faults she once had. You are the\\r\\nonly being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said; but you\\r\\nhave always known my opinion of her; you can bear me witness, Fanny,\\r\\nthat I have never been blinded. How many a time have we talked over\\r\\nher little errors! You need not fear me; I have almost given up every\\r\\nserious idea of her; but I must be a blockhead indeed, if, whatever\\r\\nbefell me, I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the\\r\\nsincerest gratitude.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen. He had said\\r\\nenough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known,\\r\\nand with a brighter look, she answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, cousin, I am convinced\\r\\nthat _you_ would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some\\r\\nmight not. I cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say. Do\\r\\nnot check yourself. Tell me whatever you like.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now on the second floor, and the appearance of a housemaid\\r\\nprevented any farther conversation. For Fanny's present comfort it was\\r\\nconcluded, perhaps, at the happiest moment: had he been able to talk\\r\\nanother five minutes, there is no saying that he might not have talked\\r\\naway all Miss Crawford's faults and his own despondence. But as it was,\\r\\nthey parted with looks on his side of grateful affection, and with\\r\\nsome very precious sensations on hers. She had felt nothing like it for\\r\\nhours. Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford's note to William had worn\\r\\naway, she had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had been\\r\\nno comfort around, no hope within her. Now everything was smiling.\\r\\nWilliam's good fortune returned again upon her mind, and seemed of\\r\\ngreater value than at first. The ball, too--such an evening of pleasure\\r\\nbefore her! It was now a real animation; and she began to dress for it\\r\\nwith much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball. All went well:\\r\\nshe did not dislike her own looks; and when she came to the necklaces\\r\\nagain, her good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one given\\r\\nher by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross.\\r\\nShe had, to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too large for\\r\\nthe purpose. His, therefore, must be worn; and having, with delightful\\r\\nfeelings, joined the chain and the cross--those memorials of the two\\r\\nmost beloved of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for each other\\r\\nby everything real and imaginary--and put them round her neck, and seen\\r\\nand felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she was able, without\\r\\nan effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford's necklace too. She\\r\\nacknowledged it to be right. Miss Crawford had a claim; and when it was\\r\\nno longer to encroach on, to interfere with the stronger claims, the\\r\\ntruer kindness of another, she could do her justice even with pleasure\\r\\nto herself. The necklace really looked very well; and Fanny left her\\r\\nroom at last, comfortably satisfied with herself and all about her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual\\r\\ndegree of wakefulness. It had really occurred to her, unprompted, that\\r\\nFanny, preparing for a ball, might be glad of better help than the upper\\r\\nhousemaid's, and when dressed herself, she actually sent her own maid to\\r\\nassist her; too late, of course, to be of any use. Mrs. Chapman had just\\r\\nreached the attic floor, when Miss Price came out of her room completely\\r\\ndressed, and only civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt her aunt's\\r\\nattention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nHer uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing-room when Fanny went\\r\\ndown. To the former she was an interesting object, and he saw with\\r\\npleasure the general elegance of her appearance, and her being in\\r\\nremarkably good looks. The neatness and propriety of her dress was all\\r\\nthat he would allow himself to commend in her presence, but upon her\\r\\nleaving the room again soon afterwards, he spoke of her beauty with very\\r\\ndecided praise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe looks very well. I sent Chapman to her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook well! Oh, yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe has good reason to look\\r\\nwell with all her advantages: brought up in this family as she has been,\\r\\nwith all the benefit of her cousins' manners before her. Only think, my\\r\\ndear Sir Thomas, what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the\\r\\nmeans of giving her. The very gown you have been taking notice of is\\r\\nyour own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married. What\\r\\nwould she have been if we had not taken her by the hand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas said no more; but when they sat down to table the eyes of\\r\\nthe two young men assured him that the subject might be gently touched\\r\\nagain, when the ladies withdrew, with more success. Fanny saw that she\\r\\nwas approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still\\r\\nbetter. From a variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon made\\r\\nstill happier; for in following her aunts out of the room, Edmund, who\\r\\nwas holding open the door, said, as she passed him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must dance\\r\\nwith me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,\\r\\nexcept the first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She had nothing more to wish for. She had hardly\\r\\never been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her life. Her\\r\\ncousins' former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to\\r\\nher; she felt it to be indeed very charming, and was actually practising\\r\\nher steps about the drawing-room as long as she could be safe from the\\r\\nnotice of her aunt Norris, who was entirely taken up at first in fresh\\r\\narranging and injuring the noble fire which the butler had prepared.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf an hour followed that would have been at least languid under any\\r\\nother circumstances, but Fanny's happiness still prevailed. It was but\\r\\nto think of her conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessness\\r\\nof Mrs. Norris? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentlemen joined them; and soon after began the sweet expectation of\\r\\na carriage, when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed diffused,\\r\\nand they all stood about and talked and laughed, and every moment had\\r\\nits pleasure and its hope. Fanny felt that there must be a struggle\\r\\nin Edmund's cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the effort so\\r\\nsuccessfully made.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the carriages were really heard, when the guests began really to\\r\\nassemble, her own gaiety of heart was much subdued: the sight of so\\r\\nmany strangers threw her back into herself; and besides the gravity and\\r\\nformality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither Sir\\r\\nThomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away, she found herself\\r\\noccasionally called on to endure something worse. She was introduced\\r\\nhere and there by her uncle, and forced to be spoken to, and to curtsey,\\r\\nand speak again. This was a hard duty, and she was never summoned to\\r\\nit without looking at William, as he walked about at his ease in the\\r\\nbackground of the scene, and longing to be with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch. The\\r\\nstiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and\\r\\nmore diffused intimacies: little groups were formed, and everybody grew\\r\\ncomfortable. Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils\\r\\nof civility, would have been again most happy, could she have kept her\\r\\neyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford. _She_ looked all\\r\\nloveliness--and what might not be the end of it? Her own musings\\r\\nwere brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, and\\r\\nher thoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost\\r\\ninstantly for the first two dances. Her happiness on this occasion was\\r\\nvery much _a_ _la_ _mortal_, finely chequered. To be secure of a partner\\r\\nat first was a most essential good--for the moment of beginning was now\\r\\ngrowing seriously near; and she so little understood her own claims as\\r\\nto think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her, she must have been the\\r\\nlast to be sought after, and should have received a partner only through\\r\\na series of inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would have been\\r\\nterrible; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his manner of\\r\\nasking her which she did not like, and she saw his eye glancing for\\r\\na moment at her necklace, with a smile--she thought there was a\\r\\nsmile--which made her blush and feel wretched. And though there was no\\r\\nsecond glance to disturb her, though his object seemed then to be only\\r\\nquietly agreeable, she could not get the better of her embarrassment,\\r\\nheightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it, and had no\\r\\ncomposure till he turned away to some one else. Then she could gradually\\r\\nrise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a partner, a voluntary\\r\\npartner, secured against the dancing began.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the company were moving into the ballroom, she found herself\\r\\nfor the first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles were\\r\\nimmediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother's had been,\\r\\nand who was beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxious\\r\\nto get the story over, hastened to give the explanation of the second\\r\\nnecklace: the real chain. Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended\\r\\ncompliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she felt only one\\r\\nthing; and her eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could\\r\\nyet be brighter, she exclaimed with eager pleasure, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid he? Did Edmund?\\r\\nThat was like himself. No other man would have thought of it. I honour\\r\\nhim beyond expression.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And she looked around as if longing to tell him\\r\\nso. He was not near, he was attending a party of ladies out of the room;\\r\\nand Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm of each,\\r\\nthey followed with the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's heart sunk, but there was no leisure for thinking long even of\\r\\nMiss Crawford's feelings. They were in the ballroom, the violins were\\r\\nplaying, and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on\\r\\nanything serious. She must watch the general arrangements, and see how\\r\\neverything was done.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her, and asked if she were engaged;\\r\\nand the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was exactly what he had intended\\r\\nto hear. Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her,\\r\\nsaying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she_ was to lead the\\r\\nway and open the ball; an idea that had never occurred to her before.\\r\\nWhenever she had thought of the minutiae of the evening, it had been as\\r\\na matter of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford; and the\\r\\nimpression was so strong, that though _her_ _uncle_ spoke the contrary,\\r\\nshe could not help an exclamation of surprise, a hint of her unfitness,\\r\\nan entreaty even to be excused. To be urging her opinion against Sir\\r\\nThomas's was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her\\r\\nhorror at the first suggestion, that she could actually look him in\\r\\nthe face and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise; in vain,\\r\\nhowever: Sir Thomas smiled, tried to encourage her, and then looked too\\r\\nserious, and said too decidedly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must be so, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for her to\\r\\nhazard another word; and she found herself the next moment conducted by\\r\\nMr. Crawford to the top of the room, and standing there to be joined by\\r\\nthe rest of the dancers, couple after couple, as they were formed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could hardly believe it. To be placed above so many elegant young\\r\\nwomen! The distinction was too great. It was treating her like her\\r\\ncousins! And her thoughts flew to those absent cousins with most\\r\\nunfeigned and truly tender regret, that they were not at home to take\\r\\ntheir own place in the room, and have their share of a pleasure which\\r\\nwould have been so very delightful to them. So often as she had heard\\r\\nthem wish for a ball at home as the greatest of all felicities! And\\r\\nto have them away when it was given--and for _her_ to be opening the\\r\\nball--and with Mr. Crawford too! She hoped they would not envy her that\\r\\ndistinction _now_; but when she looked back to the state of things in\\r\\nthe autumn, to what they had all been to each other when once dancing\\r\\nin that house before, the present arrangement was almost more than she\\r\\ncould understand herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ball began. It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny, for the\\r\\nfirst dance at least: her partner was in excellent spirits, and tried to\\r\\nimpart them to her; but she was a great deal too much frightened to have\\r\\nany enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at. Young,\\r\\npretty, and gentle, however, she had no awkwardnesses that were not\\r\\nas good as graces, and there were few persons present that were not\\r\\ndisposed to praise her. She was attractive, she was modest, she was Sir\\r\\nThomas's niece, and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford. It\\r\\nwas enough to give her general favour. Sir Thomas himself was watching\\r\\nher progress down the dance with much complacency; he was proud of his\\r\\nniece; and without attributing all her personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris\\r\\nseemed to do, to her transplantation to Mansfield, he was pleased with\\r\\nhimself for having supplied everything else: education and manners she\\r\\nowed to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas's thoughts as he stood, and having,\\r\\nin spite of all his wrongs towards her, a general prevailing desire of\\r\\nrecommending herself to him, took an opportunity of stepping aside to\\r\\nsay something agreeable of Fanny. Her praise was warm, and he\\r\\nreceived it as she could wish, joining in it as far as discretion, and\\r\\npoliteness, and slowness of speech would allow, and certainly appearing\\r\\nto greater advantage on the subject than his lady did soon afterwards,\\r\\nwhen Mary, perceiving her on a sofa very near, turned round before she\\r\\nbegan to dance, to compliment her on Miss Price's looks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, she does look very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Lady Bertram's placid reply.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChapman helped her to dress. I sent Chapman to her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Not but that\\r\\nshe was really pleased to have Fanny admired; but she was so much more\\r\\nstruck with her own kindness in sending Chapman to her, that she could\\r\\nnot get it out of her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _her_\\r\\nby commendation of Fanny; to her, it was as the occasion offered--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh!\\r\\nma'am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nMrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had\\r\\ntime for, amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making\\r\\nup card-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas, and trying to move all the\\r\\nchaperons to a better part of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her intentions\\r\\nto please. She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter,\\r\\nand filling her with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and,\\r\\nmisinterpreting Fanny's blushes, still thought she must be doing so when\\r\\nshe went to her after the two first dances, and said, with a significant\\r\\nlook, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother goes to town to-morrow?\\r\\nHe says he has business there, but will not tell me what. The first time\\r\\nhe ever denied me his confidence! But this is what we all come to.\\r\\nAll are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply to you for\\r\\ninformation. Pray, what is Henry going for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny protested her ignorance as steadily as her embarrassment allowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Crawford, laughing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must suppose it to be\\r\\npurely for the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of you\\r\\nby the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent; while Miss\\r\\nCrawford wondered she did not smile, and thought her over-anxious,\\r\\nor thought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible of\\r\\npleasure in Henry's attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in\\r\\nthe course of the evening; but Henry's attentions had very little to\\r\\ndo with it. She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again so\\r\\nvery soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his\\r\\nprevious inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for\\r\\nthe sake of securing her at that part of the evening. But it was not to\\r\\nbe avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she\\r\\ncould not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy\\r\\nor ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William,\\r\\nhe was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart\\r\\nwhich did him credit. But still his attentions made no part of her\\r\\nsatisfaction. She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw how\\r\\nperfectly he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she could\\r\\nwalk about with him and hear his account of his partners; she was happy\\r\\nin knowing herself admired; and she was happy in having the two dances\\r\\nwith Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest part of the\\r\\nevening, her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite\\r\\nengagement with _him_ was in continual perspective. She was happy even\\r\\nwhen they did take place; but not from any flow of spirits on his side,\\r\\nor any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning.\\r\\nHis mind was fagged, and her happiness sprung from being the friend with\\r\\nwhom it could find repose. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am worn out with civility,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nhave been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say. But\\r\\nwith _you_, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not want to be talked\\r\\nto. Let us have the luxury of silence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fanny would hardly even speak\\r\\nher agreement. A weariness, arising probably, in great measure, from the\\r\\nsame feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning, was peculiarly\\r\\nto be respected, and they went down their two dances together with such\\r\\nsober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on that Sir Thomas had\\r\\nbeen bringing up no wife for his younger son.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure. Miss Crawford had\\r\\nbeen in gay spirits when they first danced together, but it was not her\\r\\ngaiety that could do him good: it rather sank than raised his comfort;\\r\\nand afterwards, for he found himself still impelled to seek her\\r\\nagain, she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the\\r\\nprofession to which he was now on the point of belonging. They had\\r\\ntalked, and they had been silent; he had reasoned, she had ridiculed;\\r\\nand they had parted at last with mutual vexation. Fanny, not able to\\r\\nrefrain entirely from observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably\\r\\nsatisfied. It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering. Yet\\r\\nsome happiness must and would arise from the very conviction that he did\\r\\nsuffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her two dances with him were over, her inclination and strength for\\r\\nmore were pretty well at an end; and Sir Thomas, having seen her walk\\r\\nrather than dance down the shortening set, breathless, and with her hand\\r\\nat her side, gave his orders for her sitting down entirely. From that\\r\\ntime Mr. Crawford sat down likewise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Fanny!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried William, coming for a moment to visit her, and\\r\\nworking away his partner's fan as if for life, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow soon she is knocked\\r\\nup! Why, the sport is but just begun. I hope we shall keep it up these\\r\\ntwo hours. How can you be tired so soon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo soon! my good friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, producing his watch with all\\r\\nnecessary caution; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is three o'clock, and your sister is not used to\\r\\nthese sort of hours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go. Sleep as\\r\\nlong as you can, and never mind me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! William.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat! Did she think of being up before you set off?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny, rising eagerly from her seat to be nearer\\r\\nher uncle; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must get up and breakfast with him. It will be the last\\r\\ntime, you know; the last morning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better not. He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half-past\\r\\nnine. Mr. Crawford, I think you call for him at half-past nine?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was too urgent, however, and had too many tears in her eyes for\\r\\ndenial; and it ended in a gracious \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which was permission.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, half-past nine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Crawford to William as the latter was\\r\\nleaving them, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind sister\\r\\nto get up for _me_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And in a lower tone to Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall have only\\r\\na desolate house to hurry from. Your brother will find my ideas of time\\r\\nand his own very different to-morrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the early\\r\\nbreakfast party in that house instead of eating alone: he should himself\\r\\nbe of it; and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted\\r\\nconvinced him that the suspicions whence, he must confess to himself,\\r\\nthis very ball had in great measure sprung, were well founded. Mr.\\r\\nCrawford was in love with Fanny. He had a pleasing anticipation of what\\r\\nwould be. His niece, meanwhile, did not thank him for what he had just\\r\\ndone. She had hoped to have William all to herself the last morning. It\\r\\nwould have been an unspeakable indulgence. But though her wishes\\r\\nwere overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring within her. On the\\r\\ncontrary, she was so totally unused to have her pleasure consulted, or\\r\\nto have anything take place at all in the way she could desire, that she\\r\\nwas more disposed to wonder and rejoice in having carried her point so\\r\\nfar, than to repine at the counteraction which followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly afterward, Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her\\r\\ninclination, by advising her to go immediately to bed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdvise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was his\\r\\nword, but it was the advice of absolute power, and she had only to\\r\\nrise, and, with Mr. Crawford's very cordial adieus, pass quietly away;\\r\\nstopping at the entrance-door, like the Lady of Branxholm Hall, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone\\r\\nmoment and no more,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to view the happy scene, and take a last look at\\r\\nthe five or six determined couple who were still hard at work; and then,\\r\\ncreeping slowly up the principal staircase, pursued by the ceaseless\\r\\ncountry-dance, feverish with hopes and fears, soup and negus,\\r\\nsore-footed and fatigued, restless and agitated, yet feeling, in spite\\r\\nof everything, that a ball was indeed delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn thus sending her away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking\\r\\nmerely of her health. It might occur to him that Mr. Crawford had been\\r\\nsitting by her long enough, or he might mean to recommend her as a wife\\r\\nby shewing her persuadableness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kiss\\r\\nwas given, and William was gone. Mr. Crawford had, as he foretold, been\\r\\nvery punctual, and short and pleasant had been the meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the\\r\\nbreakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy\\r\\nchange; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving,\\r\\nperhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her\\r\\ntender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in\\r\\nWilliam's plate might but divide her feelings with the broken egg-shells\\r\\nin Mr. Crawford's. She sat and cried _con_ _amore_ as her uncle\\r\\nintended, but it was _con_ _amore_ fraternal and no other. William was\\r\\ngone, and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in idle cares\\r\\nand selfish solicitudes unconnected with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's disposition was such that she could never even think of her\\r\\naunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house,\\r\\nwithout reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her\\r\\nwhen they had been last together; much less could her feelings acquit\\r\\nher of having done and said and thought everything by William that was\\r\\ndue to him for a whole fortnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a heavy, melancholy day. Soon after the second breakfast, Edmund\\r\\nbade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his horse for Peterborough,\\r\\nand then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but remembrances,\\r\\nwhich she had nobody to share in. She talked to her aunt Bertram--she\\r\\nmust talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen so little of\\r\\nwhat had passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was heavy work.\\r\\nLady Bertram was not certain of anybody's dress or anybody's place at\\r\\nsupper but her own. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe could not recollect what it was that she had\\r\\nheard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was that Lady Prescott\\r\\nhad noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been\\r\\ntalking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest\\r\\nyoung man in the room--somebody had whispered something to her; she had\\r\\nforgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And these were her longest\\r\\nspeeches and clearest communications: the rest was only a languid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\r\\nyes; very well; did you? did he? I did not see _that_; I should not know\\r\\none from the other.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This was very bad. It was only better than Mrs.\\r\\nNorris's sharp answers would have been; but she being gone home with\\r\\nall the supernumerary jellies to nurse a sick maid, there was peace\\r\\nand good-humour in their little party, though it could not boast much\\r\\nbeside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was heavy like the day. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot think what is the matter\\r\\nwith me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram, when the tea-things were removed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel\\r\\nquite stupid. It must be sitting up so late last night. Fanny, you must\\r\\ndo something to keep me awake. I cannot work. Fetch the cards; I feel so\\r\\nvery stupid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till\\r\\nbedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds were\\r\\nheard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the\\r\\ngame--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd _that_ makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib. You\\r\\nare to deal, ma'am; shall I deal for you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fanny thought and thought\\r\\nagain of the difference which twenty-four hours had made in that room,\\r\\nand all that part of the house. Last night it had been hope and smiles,\\r\\nbustle and motion, noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room, and out\\r\\nof the drawing-room, and everywhere. Now it was languor, and all but\\r\\nsolitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nA good night's rest improved her spirits. She could think of William the\\r\\nnext day more cheerfully; and as the morning afforded her an opportunity\\r\\nof talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford, in a\\r\\nvery handsome style, with all the heightenings of imagination, and\\r\\nall the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a\\r\\ndeparted ball, she could afterwards bring her mind without much effort\\r\\ninto its everyday state, and easily conform to the tranquillity of the\\r\\npresent quiet week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were indeed a smaller party than she had ever known there for\\r\\na whole day together, and _he_ was gone on whom the comfort and\\r\\ncheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended.\\r\\nBut this must be learned to be endured. He would soon be always gone;\\r\\nand she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room with her\\r\\nuncle, hear his voice, receive his questions, and even answer them,\\r\\nwithout such wretched feelings as she had formerly known.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe miss our two young men,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Sir Thomas's observation on both the\\r\\nfirst and second day, as they formed their very reduced circle after\\r\\ndinner; and in consideration of Fanny's swimming eyes, nothing more was\\r\\nsaid on the first day than to drink their good health; but on the\\r\\nsecond it led to something farther. William was kindly commended and\\r\\nhis promotion hoped for. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd there is no reason to suppose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Sir\\r\\nThomas, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent. As to\\r\\nEdmund, we must learn to do without him. This will be the last winter of\\r\\nhis belonging to us, as he has done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I wish he was not going away. They are\\r\\nall going away, I think. I wish they would stay at home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied for\\r\\npermission to go to town with Maria; and as Sir Thomas thought it best\\r\\nfor each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram,\\r\\nthough in her own good-nature she would not have prevented it, was\\r\\nlamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia's return, which\\r\\nwould otherwise have taken place about this time. A great deal of good\\r\\nsense followed on Sir Thomas's side, tending to reconcile his wife to\\r\\nthe arrangement. Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feel\\r\\nwas advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate mother\\r\\n_must_ feel in promoting her children's enjoyment was attributed to her\\r\\nnature. Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and at the end\\r\\nof a quarter of an hour's silent consideration spontaneously observed,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas, I have been thinking--and I am very glad we took Fanny as\\r\\nwe did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true.\\r\\nWe shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face,\\r\\nshe is now a very valuable companion. If we have been kind to _her_, she\\r\\nis now quite as necessary to _us_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram presently; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand it is a comfort to think that\\r\\nwe shall always have _her_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece, and then gravely\\r\\nreplied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other\\r\\nhome that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows\\r\\nhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who should invite her?\\r\\nMaria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then, but she\\r\\nwould not think of asking her to live there; and I am sure she is better\\r\\noff here; and besides, I cannot do without her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the great house in\\r\\nMansfield had a very different character at the Parsonage. To the young\\r\\nlady, at least, in each family, it brought very different feelings. What\\r\\nwas tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation to\\r\\nMary. Something arose from difference of disposition and habit: one so\\r\\neasily satisfied, the other so unused to endure; but still more might be\\r\\nimputed to difference of circumstances. In some points of interest they\\r\\nwere exactly opposed to each other. To Fanny's mind, Edmund's absence\\r\\nwas really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief. To Mary it was\\r\\nevery way painful. She felt the want of his society every day, almost\\r\\nevery hour, and was too much in want of it to derive anything but\\r\\nirritation from considering the object for which he went. He could not\\r\\nhave devised anything more likely to raise his consequence than this\\r\\nweek's absence, occurring as it did at the very time of her brother's\\r\\ngoing away, of William Price's going too, and completing the sort of\\r\\ngeneral break-up of a party which had been so animated. She felt it\\r\\nkeenly. They were now a miserable trio, confined within doors by a\\r\\nseries of rain and snow, with nothing to do and no variety to hope for.\\r\\nAngry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions, and acting\\r\\non them in defiance of her (and she had been so angry that they had\\r\\nhardly parted friends at the ball), she could not help thinking of\\r\\nhim continually when absent, dwelling on his merit and affection, and\\r\\nlonging again for the almost daily meetings they lately had. His absence\\r\\nwas unnecessarily long. He should not have planned such an absence--he\\r\\nshould not have left home for a week, when her own departure from\\r\\nMansfield was so near. Then she began to blame herself. She wished she\\r\\nhad not spoken so warmly in their last conversation. She was afraid she\\r\\nhad used some strong, some contemptuous expressions in speaking of the\\r\\nclergy, and that should not have been. It was ill-bred; it was wrong.\\r\\nShe wished such words unsaid with all her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer vexation did not end with the week. All this was bad, but she had\\r\\nstill more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund;\\r\\nwhen Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slight\\r\\ncommunication with the other family which Sunday produced, she learned\\r\\nthat he had actually written home to defer his return, having promised\\r\\nto remain some days longer with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf she had felt impatience and regret before--if she had been sorry for\\r\\nwhat she said, and feared its too strong effect on him--she now felt\\r\\nand feared it all tenfold more. She had, moreover, to contend with one\\r\\ndisagreeable emotion entirely new to her--jealousy. His friend Mr.\\r\\nOwen had sisters; he might find them attractive. But, at any rate, his\\r\\nstaying away at a time when, according to all preceding plans, she was\\r\\nto remove to London, meant something that she could not bear. Had Henry\\r\\nreturned, as he talked of doing, at the end of three or four days, she\\r\\nshould now have been leaving Mansfield. It became absolutely necessary\\r\\nfor her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more. She could not\\r\\nlive any longer in such solitary wretchedness; and she made her way\\r\\nto the Park, through difficulties of walking which she had deemed\\r\\nunconquerable a week before, for the chance of hearing a little in\\r\\naddition, for the sake of at least hearing his name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together,\\r\\nand unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing. But\\r\\nat last Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately Miss\\r\\nCrawford thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she could--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd\\r\\nhow do _you_ like your cousin Edmund's staying away so long? Being the\\r\\nonly young person at home, I consider _you_ as the greatest sufferer.\\r\\nYou must miss him. Does his staying longer surprise you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny hesitatingly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; I had not particularly\\r\\nexpected it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of. It is the general\\r\\nway all young men do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe finds the house more agreeable _now_. He is a very--a very pleasing\\r\\nyoung man himself, and I cannot help being rather concerned at not\\r\\nseeing him again before I go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the\\r\\ncase. I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he comes there\\r\\nwill be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to have seen\\r\\nhim once more, I confess. But you must give my compliments to him. Yes;\\r\\nI think it must be compliments. Is not there a something wanted,\\r\\nMiss Price, in our language--a something between compliments and--and\\r\\nlove--to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together? So\\r\\nmany months' acquaintance! But compliments may be sufficient here.\\r\\nWas his letter a long one? Does he give you much account of what he is\\r\\ndoing? Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle; but I believe\\r\\nit was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines. All that I\\r\\nheard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer, and that he\\r\\nhad agreed to do so. A _few_ days longer, or _some_ days longer; I am\\r\\nnot quite sure which.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! if he wrote to his father; but I thought it might have been to Lady\\r\\nBertram or you. But if he wrote to his father, no wonder he was concise.\\r\\nWho could write chat to Sir Thomas? If he had written to you, there\\r\\nwould have been more particulars. You would have heard of balls\\r\\nand parties. He would have sent you a description of everything and\\r\\neverybody. How many Miss Owens are there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree grown up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre they musical?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not at all know. I never heard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is the first question, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Miss Crawford, trying to\\r\\nappear gay and unconcerned, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich every woman who plays herself is sure\\r\\nto ask about another. But it is very foolish to ask questions about\\r\\nany young ladies--about any three sisters just grown up; for one knows,\\r\\nwithout being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished and\\r\\npleasing, and one very pretty. There is a beauty in every family; it is\\r\\na regular thing. Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp; and\\r\\nall sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better for\\r\\nnot being taught; or something like it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know nothing of the Miss Owens,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know nothing and you care less, as people say. Never did tone\\r\\nexpress indifference plainer. Indeed, how can one care for those one has\\r\\nnever seen? Well, when your cousin comes back, he will find Mansfield\\r\\nvery quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself. I\\r\\ndo not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near. She\\r\\ndoes not like my going.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny felt obliged to speak. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot doubt your being missed by\\r\\nmany,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will be very much missed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford turned her eye on her, as if wanting to hear or see more,\\r\\nand then laughingly said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes! missed as every noisy evil is missed\\r\\nwhen it is taken away; that is, there is a great difference felt. But I\\r\\nam not fishing; don't compliment me. If I _am_ missed, it will appear.\\r\\nI may be discovered by those who want to see me. I shall not be in any\\r\\ndoubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss Crawford was\\r\\ndisappointed; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her\\r\\npower from one who she thought must know, and her spirits were clouded\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Miss Owens,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, soon afterwards; \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuppose you were to have\\r\\none of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey; how should you like it?\\r\\nStranger things have happened. I dare say they are trying for it. And\\r\\nthey are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty establishment\\r\\nfor them. I do not at all wonder or blame them. It is everybody's duty\\r\\nto do as well for themselves as they can. Sir Thomas Bertram's son is\\r\\nsomebody; and now he is in their own line. Their father is a clergyman,\\r\\nand their brother is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen together.\\r\\nHe is their lawful property; he fairly belongs to them. You don't speak,\\r\\nFanny; Miss Price, you don't speak. But honestly now, do not you rather\\r\\nexpect it than otherwise?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny stoutly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not expect it at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Crawford with alacrity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder at that. But\\r\\nI dare say you know exactly--I always imagine you are--perhaps you do\\r\\nnot think him likely to marry at all--or not at present.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I do not,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err either in the\\r\\nbelief or the acknowledgment of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer companion looked at her keenly; and gathering greater spirit from\\r\\nthe blush soon produced from such a look, only said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is best off as\\r\\nhe is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and turned the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Crawford's uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, and\\r\\nshe walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another\\r\\nweek of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put\\r\\nto the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother down from\\r\\nLondon again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, she\\r\\nhad nothing farther to try her own. His still refusing to tell her what\\r\\nhe had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might\\r\\nhave irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke--suspected only of\\r\\nconcealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And the\\r\\nnext day _did_ bring a surprise to her. Henry had said he should just\\r\\ngo and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but\\r\\nhe was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting for\\r\\nhim to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most impatiently in\\r\\nthe sweep, and cried out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Henry, where can you have been\\r\\nall this time?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady\\r\\nBertram and Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSitting with them an hour and a half!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was only the beginning of her surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, Mary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, drawing her arm within his, and walking along\\r\\nthe sweep as if not knowing where he was: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could not get away sooner;\\r\\nFanny looked so lovely! I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is entirely\\r\\nmade up. Will it astonish you? No: you must be aware that I am quite\\r\\ndetermined to marry Fanny Price.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever his\\r\\nconsciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having any such views\\r\\nhad never entered his sister's imagination; and she looked so truly the\\r\\nastonishment she felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said,\\r\\nand more fully and more solemnly. The conviction of his determination\\r\\nonce admitted, it was not unwelcome. There was even pleasure with the\\r\\nsurprise. Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with the\\r\\nBertram family, and to be not displeased with her brother's marrying a\\r\\nlittle beneath him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, Mary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Henry's concluding assurance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am fairly caught.\\r\\nYou know with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them.\\r\\nI have, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her\\r\\naffections; but my own are entirely fixed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLucky, lucky girl!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mary, as soon as she could speak; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat a\\r\\nmatch for her! My dearest Henry, this must be my _first_ feeling; but\\r\\nmy _second_, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your\\r\\nchoice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish\\r\\nand desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and\\r\\ndevotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an amazing match for her! Mrs.\\r\\nNorris often talks of her luck; what will she say now? The delight\\r\\nof all the family, indeed! And she has some _true_ friends in it! How\\r\\n_they_ will rejoice! But tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever. When\\r\\ndid you begin to think seriously about her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, though\\r\\nnothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow the pleasing\\r\\nplague had stolen on him\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he could not say; and before he had expressed\\r\\nthe same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over,\\r\\nhis sister eagerly interrupted him with, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, my dear Henry, and this\\r\\nis what took you to London! This was your business! You chose to consult\\r\\nthe Admiral before you made up your mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this he stoutly denied. He knew his uncle too well to consult him on\\r\\nany matrimonial scheme. The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it never\\r\\npardonable in a young man of independent fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen Fanny is known to him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Henry, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che will doat on her.\\r\\nShe is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as\\r\\nthe Admiral, for she he would describe, if indeed he has now delicacy\\r\\nof language enough to embody his own ideas. But till it is absolutely\\r\\nsettled--settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of the\\r\\nmatter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You have not discovered my\\r\\nbusiness yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it must relate, and am\\r\\nin no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! That\\r\\nMansfield should have done so much for--that _you_ should have found\\r\\nyour fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not have\\r\\nchosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, and you do not\\r\\nwant for fortune; and as to her connexions, they are more than good. The\\r\\nBertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country. She\\r\\nis niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world. But\\r\\ngo on, go on. Tell me more. What are your plans? Does she know her own\\r\\nhappiness?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are you waiting for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor--for very little more than opportunity. Mary, she is not like her\\r\\ncousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no! you cannot. Were you even less pleasing--supposing her not to\\r\\nlove you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)--you would\\r\\nbe safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure\\r\\nher all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she would\\r\\nmarry you _without_ love; that is, if there is a girl in the world\\r\\ncapable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but ask\\r\\nher to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tell\\r\\nas she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply\\r\\ninteresting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to\\r\\nrelate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny's charms.\\r\\nFanny's beauty of face and figure, Fanny's graces of manner and goodness\\r\\nof heart, were the exhaustless theme. The gentleness, modesty, and\\r\\nsweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on; that sweetness\\r\\nwhich makes so essential a part of every woman's worth in the judgment\\r\\nof man, that though he sometimes loves where it is not, he can never\\r\\nbelieve it absent. Her temper he had good reason to depend on and\\r\\nto praise. He had often seen it tried. Was there one of the family,\\r\\nexcepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually exercised\\r\\nher patience and forbearance? Her affections were evidently strong. To\\r\\nsee her with her brother! What could more delightfully prove that the\\r\\nwarmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness? What could be more\\r\\nencouraging to a man who had her love in view? Then, her understanding\\r\\nwas beyond every suspicion, quick and clear; and her manners were the\\r\\nmirror of her own modest and elegant mind. Nor was this all. Henry\\r\\nCrawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles\\r\\nin a wife, though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection to\\r\\nknow them by their proper name; but when he talked of her having such a\\r\\nsteadiness and regularity of conduct, such a high notion of honour, and\\r\\nsuch an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest\\r\\ndependence on her faith and integrity, he expressed what was inspired by\\r\\nthe knowledge of her being well principled and religious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could so wholly and absolutely confide in her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand _that_\\r\\nis what I want.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWell might his sister, believing as she really did that his opinion of\\r\\nFanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits, rejoice in her prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe more I think of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe more am I convinced that you\\r\\nare doing quite right; and though I should never have selected Fanny\\r\\nPrice as the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she is\\r\\nthe very one to make you happy. Your wicked project upon her peace turns\\r\\nout a clever thought indeed. You will both find your good in it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was bad, very bad in me against such a creature; but I did not know\\r\\nher then; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put\\r\\nit into my head. I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she has\\r\\never yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else. I will not take her\\r\\nfrom Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in this\\r\\nneighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge. I shall let a seven years' lease\\r\\nof Everingham. I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word. I could\\r\\nname three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHa!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mary; \\xe2\\x80\\x9csettle in Northamptonshire! That is pleasant! Then we\\r\\nshall be all together.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had spoken it, she recollected herself, and wished it unsaid;\\r\\nbut there was no need of confusion; for her brother saw her only as the\\r\\nsupposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her in\\r\\nthe kindest manner to his own house, and to claim the best right in her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must give us more than half your time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot admit\\r\\nMrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall\\r\\nboth have a right in you. Fanny will be so truly your sister!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had only to be grateful and give general assurances; but she was\\r\\nnow very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sister\\r\\nmany months longer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat's right; and in London, of course, a house of your own: no longer\\r\\nwith the Admiral. My dearest Henry, the advantage to you of getting away\\r\\nfrom the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his,\\r\\nbefore you have contracted any of his foolish opinions, or learned to\\r\\nsit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life! _You_ are\\r\\nnot sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you; but,\\r\\nin my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you. To have\\r\\nseen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture, would\\r\\nhave broken my heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well, we do not think quite alike here. The Admiral has his\\r\\nfaults, but he is a very good man, and has been more than a father to\\r\\nme. Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much. You must\\r\\nnot prejudice Fanny against him. I must have them love one another.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary refrained from saying what she felt, that there could not be two\\r\\npersons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant:\\r\\ntime would discover it to him; but she could not help _this_ reflection\\r\\non the Admiral. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHenry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I\\r\\ncould suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which\\r\\nmy poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the\\r\\nmarriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you _loved_\\r\\nwould be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to\\r\\nlove, she would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a\\r\\ngentleman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny\\r\\nPrice happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course the\\r\\ngroundwork of his eloquent answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHad you seen her this morning, Mary,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cattending with\\r\\nsuch ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt's\\r\\nstupidity, working with her, and for her, her colour beautifully\\r\\nheightened as she leant over the work, then returning to her seat to\\r\\nfinish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that\\r\\nstupid woman's service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness,\\r\\nso much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a\\r\\nmoment at her own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is,\\r\\nand one little curl falling forward as she wrote, which she now and then\\r\\nshook back, and in the midst of all this, still speaking at intervals to\\r\\n_me_, or listening, and as if she liked to listen, to what I said. Had\\r\\nyou seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied the possibility of her\\r\\npower over my heart ever ceasing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dearest Henry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling in his face,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chow glad I am to see you so much in love! It quite delights me. But\\r\\nwhat will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see what\\r\\nsort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of sense.\\r\\nI wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see their\\r\\ncousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily\\r\\nashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They will be\\r\\nangry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, after a moment's silence, and in a cooler tone; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMrs.\\r\\nRushworth will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to her; that is,\\r\\nlike other bitter pills, it will have two moments' ill flavour, and then\\r\\nbe swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose\\r\\nher feelings more lasting than other women's, though _I_ was the object\\r\\nof them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a difference indeed: a daily,\\r\\nhourly difference, in the behaviour of every being who approaches her;\\r\\nand it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer\\r\\nof it, that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due.\\r\\nNow she is dependent, helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or\\r\\nforgotten. Her cousin Edmund never forgets her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEdmund! True, I believe he is, generally speaking, kind to her, and\\r\\nso is Sir Thomas in his way; but it is the way of a rich, superior,\\r\\nlong-worded, arbitrary uncle. What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together\\r\\ndo, what do they _do_ for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity in\\r\\nthe world, to what I _shall_ do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an\\r\\nearlier hour than common visiting warrants. The two ladies were together\\r\\nin the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him, Lady Bertram was on the\\r\\nvery point of quitting it as he entered. She was almost at the door, and\\r\\nnot chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain, she still went\\r\\non, after a civil reception, a short sentence about being waited for,\\r\\nand a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet Sir Thomas know\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry, overjoyed to have her go, bowed and watched her off, and without\\r\\nlosing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny, and, taking out some\\r\\nletters, said, with a most animated look, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must acknowledge myself\\r\\ninfinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity\\r\\nof seeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have any\\r\\nidea. Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could hardly\\r\\nhave borne that any one in the house should share with you in the\\r\\nfirst knowledge of the news I now bring. He is made. Your brother is a\\r\\nlieutenant. I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on\\r\\nyour brother's promotion. Here are the letters which announce it, this\\r\\nmoment come to hand. You will, perhaps, like to see them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny could not speak, but he did not want her to speak. To see the\\r\\nexpression of her eyes, the change of her complexion, the progress of\\r\\nher feelings, their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough. She took\\r\\nthe letters as he gave them. The first was from the Admiral to inform\\r\\nhis nephew, in a few words, of his having succeeded in the object he had\\r\\nundertaken, the promotion of young Price, and enclosing two more, one\\r\\nfrom the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend, whom the Admiral had\\r\\nset to work in the business, the other from that friend to himself,\\r\\nby which it appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness of\\r\\nattending to the recommendation of Sir Charles; that Sir Charles was\\r\\nmuch delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his regard\\r\\nfor Admiral Crawford, and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price's\\r\\ncommission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made out was\\r\\nspreading general joy through a wide circle of great people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile her hand was trembling under these letters, her eye running from\\r\\none to the other, and her heart swelling with emotion, Crawford thus\\r\\ncontinued, with unfeigned eagerness, to express his interest in the\\r\\nevent--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not talk of my own happiness,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat as it is, for I\\r\\nthink only of yours. Compared with you, who has a right to be happy? I\\r\\nhave almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to\\r\\nhave known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however.\\r\\nThe post was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment's\\r\\ndelay. How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject,\\r\\nI will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly\\r\\ndisappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London! I was\\r\\nkept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear\\r\\nto me than such an object would have detained me half the time from\\r\\nMansfield. But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the\\r\\nwarmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were\\r\\ndifficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of\\r\\nanother, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and\\r\\nknowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday,\\r\\ntrusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by\\r\\nsuch very letters as these. My uncle, who is the very best man in\\r\\nthe world, has exerted himself, as I knew he would, after seeing your\\r\\nbrother. He was delighted with him. I would not allow myself yesterday\\r\\nto say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his\\r\\npraise. I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of\\r\\na friend, as this day _does_ prove it. _Now_ I may say that even I could\\r\\nnot require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be followed\\r\\nby warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most voluntarily\\r\\nbestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHas this been all _your_ doing, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood heaven! how\\r\\nvery, very kind! Have you really--was it by _your_ desire? I beg your\\r\\npardon, but I am bewildered. Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was it? I\\r\\nam stupefied.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry was most happy to make it more intelligible, by beginning at an\\r\\nearlier stage, and explaining very particularly what he had done. His\\r\\nlast journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that\\r\\nof introducing her brother in Hill Street, and prevailing on the Admiral\\r\\nto exert whatever interest he might have for getting him on. This had\\r\\nbeen his business. He had communicated it to no creature: he had not\\r\\nbreathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the issue,\\r\\nhe could not have borne any participation of his feelings, but this had\\r\\nbeen his business; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude\\r\\nhad been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding in the\\r\\n_deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_ _wishes_\\r\\n_more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have remained\\r\\ninsensible of his drift, had she been able to attend; but her heart was\\r\\nso full and her senses still so astonished, that she could listen but\\r\\nimperfectly even to what he told her of William, and saying only when\\r\\nhe paused, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow kind! how very kind! Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are infinitely\\r\\nobliged to you! Dearest, dearest William!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She jumped up and moved in\\r\\nhaste towards the door, crying out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will go to my uncle. My uncle\\r\\nought to know it as soon as possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But this could not be suffered.\\r\\nThe opportunity was too fair, and his feelings too impatient. He was\\r\\nafter her immediately. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe must not go, she must allow him five minutes\\r\\nlonger,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he took her hand and led her back to her seat, and was in\\r\\nthe middle of his farther explanation, before she had suspected for what\\r\\nshe was detained. When she did understand it, however, and found herself\\r\\nexpected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart had\\r\\nnever known before, and that everything he had done for William was to\\r\\nbe placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled attachment\\r\\nto her, she was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments unable\\r\\nto speak. She considered it all as nonsense, as mere trifling and\\r\\ngallantry, which meant only to deceive for the hour; she could not but\\r\\nfeel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily, and in such a\\r\\nway as she had not deserved; but it was like himself, and entirely of a\\r\\npiece with what she had seen before; and she would not allow herself to\\r\\nshew half the displeasure she felt, because he had been conferring an\\r\\nobligation, which no want of delicacy on his part could make a trifle\\r\\nto her. While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude on\\r\\nWilliam's behalf, she could not be severely resentful of anything that\\r\\ninjured only herself; and after having twice drawn back her hand, and\\r\\ntwice attempted in vain to turn away from him, she got up, and said\\r\\nonly, with much agitation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon't, Mr. Crawford, pray don't! I beg you\\r\\nwould not. This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me. I\\r\\nmust go away. I cannot bear it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But he was still talking on, describing\\r\\nhis affection, soliciting a return, and, finally, in words so plain as\\r\\nto bear but one meaning even to her, offering himself, hand, fortune,\\r\\neverything, to her acceptance. It was so; he had said it. Her\\r\\nastonishment and confusion increased; and though still not knowing\\r\\nhow to suppose him serious, she could hardly stand. He pressed for an\\r\\nanswer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, hiding her face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is all nonsense. Do not\\r\\ndistress me. I can hear no more of this. Your kindness to William makes\\r\\nme more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, I\\r\\ncannot bear, I must not listen to such--No, no, don't think of me. But\\r\\nyou are _not_ thinking of me. I know it is all nothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had burst away from him, and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard\\r\\nspeaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in. It was\\r\\nno time for farther assurances or entreaty, though to part with her at\\r\\na moment when her modesty alone seemed, to his sanguine and preassured\\r\\nmind, to stand in the way of the happiness he sought, was a cruel\\r\\nnecessity. She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle\\r\\nwas approaching, and was walking up and down the East room in the\\r\\nutmost confusion of contrary feeling, before Sir Thomas's politeness\\r\\nor apologies were over, or he had reached the beginning of the joyful\\r\\nintelligence which his visitor came to communicate.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything; agitated, happy,\\r\\nmiserable, infinitely obliged, absolutely angry. It was all beyond\\r\\nbelief! He was inexcusable, incomprehensible! But such were his habits\\r\\nthat he could do nothing without a mixture of evil. He had previously\\r\\nmade her the happiest of human beings, and now he had insulted--she knew\\r\\nnot what to say, how to class, or how to regard it. She would not have\\r\\nhim be serious, and yet what could excuse the use of such words and\\r\\noffers, if they meant but to trifle?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut William was a lieutenant. _That_ was a fact beyond a doubt, and\\r\\nwithout an alloy. She would think of it for ever and forget all the\\r\\nrest. Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again: he must\\r\\nhave seen how unwelcome it was to her; and in that case, how gratefully\\r\\nshe could esteem him for his friendship to William!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great\\r\\nstaircase, till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford's having left\\r\\nthe house; but when convinced of his being gone, she was eager to go\\r\\ndown and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness of his joy\\r\\nas well as her own, and all the benefit of his information or his\\r\\nconjectures as to what would now be William's destination. Sir Thomas\\r\\nwas as joyful as she could desire, and very kind and communicative; and\\r\\nshe had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her\\r\\nfeel as if nothing had occurred to vex her, till she found, towards the\\r\\nclose, that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that\\r\\nvery day. This was a most unwelcome hearing, for though he might think\\r\\nnothing of what had passed, it would be quite distressing to her to see\\r\\nhim again so soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to get the better of it; tried very hard, as the dinner hour\\r\\napproached, to feel and appear as usual; but it was quite impossible for\\r\\nher not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor entered\\r\\nthe room. She could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrence\\r\\nof circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on the first day\\r\\nof hearing of William's promotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Crawford was not only in the room--he was soon close to her. He\\r\\nhad a note to deliver from his sister. Fanny could not look at him, but\\r\\nthere was no consciousness of past folly in his voice. She opened her\\r\\nnote immediately, glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she read\\r\\nit, to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris, who was also to dine\\r\\nthere, screened her a little from view.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Fanny,--for so I may now always call you, to the infinite\\r\\nrelief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _Miss_ _Price_ for at\\r\\nleast the last six weeks--I cannot let my brother go without sending you\\r\\na few lines of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful consent\\r\\nand approval. Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear; there can be no\\r\\ndifficulties worth naming. I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my\\r\\nconsent will be something; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest\\r\\nsmiles this afternoon, and send him back to me even happier than he\\r\\ngoes.--Yours affectionately, M. C.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were not expressions to do Fanny any good; for though she read\\r\\nin too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss\\r\\nCrawford's meaning, it was evident that she meant to compliment her on\\r\\nher brother's attachment, and even to _appear_ to believe it serious.\\r\\nShe did not know what to do, or what to think. There was wretchedness in\\r\\nthe idea of its being serious; there was perplexity and agitation every\\r\\nway. She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her, and he spoke\\r\\nto her much too often; and she was afraid there was a something in his\\r\\nvoice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were\\r\\nwhen he talked to the others. Her comfort in that day's dinner was\\r\\nquite destroyed: she could hardly eat anything; and when Sir Thomas\\r\\ngood-humouredly observed that joy had taken away her appetite, she\\r\\nwas ready to sink with shame, from the dread of Mr. Crawford's\\r\\ninterpretation; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn\\r\\nher eyes to the right hand, where he sat, she felt that _his_ were\\r\\nimmediately directed towards her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was more silent than ever. She would hardly join even when William\\r\\nwas the subject, for his commission came all from the right hand too,\\r\\nand there was pain in the connexion.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began to be in\\r\\ndespair of ever getting away; but at last they were in the drawing-room,\\r\\nand she was able to think as she would, while her aunts finished the\\r\\nsubject of William's appointment in their own style.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to\\r\\nSir Thomas as with any part of it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_Now_ William would be able to keep\\r\\nhimself, which would make a vast difference to his uncle, for it was\\r\\nunknown how much he had cost his uncle; and, indeed, it would make some\\r\\ndifference in _her_ presents too. She was very glad that she had given\\r\\nWilliam what she did at parting, very glad, indeed, that it had been in\\r\\nher power, without material inconvenience, just at that time to give him\\r\\nsomething rather considerable; that is, for _her_, with _her_ limited\\r\\nmeans, for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin.\\r\\nShe knew he must be at some expense, that he would have many things to\\r\\nbuy, though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in\\r\\nthe way of getting everything very cheap; but she was very glad she had\\r\\ncontributed her mite towards it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad you gave him something considerable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lady Bertram, with\\r\\nmost unsuspicious calmness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor _I_ gave him only 10 pounds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Norris, reddening. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, he must have gone\\r\\noff with his pockets well lined, and at no expense for his journey to\\r\\nLondon either!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas told me 10 pounds would be enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency,\\r\\nbegan to take the matter in another point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is amazing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow much young people cost their friends,\\r\\nwhat with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! They\\r\\nlittle think how much it comes to, or what their parents, or their\\r\\nuncles and aunts, pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here are\\r\\nmy sister Price's children; take them all together, I dare say nobody\\r\\nwould believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say nothing\\r\\nof what _I_ do for them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery true, sister, as you say. But, poor things! they cannot help\\r\\nit; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas. Fanny,\\r\\nWilliam must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies; and I\\r\\nshall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having. I\\r\\nwish he may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think I\\r\\nwill have two shawls, Fanny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it, was very\\r\\nearnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at. There\\r\\nwas everything in the world _against_ their being serious but his words\\r\\nand manner. Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against it;\\r\\nall their habits and ways of thinking, and all her own demerits. How\\r\\ncould _she_ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so\\r\\nmany, and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many, infinitely\\r\\nher superiors; who seemed so little open to serious impressions, even\\r\\nwhere pains had been taken to please him; who thought so slightly, so\\r\\ncarelessly, so unfeelingly on all such points; who was everything to\\r\\neverybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him? And farther,\\r\\nhow could it be supposed that his sister, with all her high and worldly\\r\\nnotions of matrimony, would be forwarding anything of a serious nature\\r\\nin such a quarter? Nothing could be more unnatural in either. Fanny\\r\\nwas ashamed of her own doubts. Everything might be possible rather than\\r\\nserious attachment, or serious approbation of it toward her. She had\\r\\nquite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford\\r\\njoined them. The difficulty was in maintaining the conviction quite so\\r\\nabsolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room; for once or twice a\\r\\nlook seemed forced on her which she did not know how to class among the\\r\\ncommon meaning; in any other man, at least, she would have said that\\r\\nit meant something very earnest, very pointed. But she still tried to\\r\\nbelieve it no more than what he might often have expressed towards her\\r\\ncousins and fifty other women.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard by the rest. She\\r\\nfancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals, whenever\\r\\nSir Thomas was out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris, and\\r\\nshe carefully refused him every opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last--it seemed an at last to Fanny's nervousness, though not\\r\\nremarkably late--he began to talk of going away; but the comfort of the\\r\\nsound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment, and saying,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you nothing to send to Mary? No answer to her note? She will be\\r\\ndisappointed if she receives nothing from you. Pray write to her, if it\\r\\nbe only a line.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes! certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny, rising in haste, the haste of\\r\\nembarrassment and of wanting to get away--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will write directly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went accordingly to the table, where she was in the habit of writing\\r\\nfor her aunt, and prepared her materials without knowing what in the\\r\\nworld to say. She had read Miss Crawford's note only once, and how to\\r\\nreply to anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing.\\r\\nQuite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had there been time for\\r\\nscruples and fears as to style she would have felt them in abundance:\\r\\nbut something must be instantly written; and with only one decided\\r\\nfeeling, that of wishing not to appear to think anything really\\r\\nintended, she wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and hand--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford, for your kind\\r\\ncongratulations, as far as they relate to my dearest William. The rest\\r\\nof your note I know means nothing; but I am so unequal to anything of\\r\\nthe sort, that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther\\r\\nnotice. I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his\\r\\nmanners; if he understood me as well, he would, I dare say, behave\\r\\ndifferently. I do not know what I write, but it would be a great favour\\r\\nof you never to mention the subject again. With thanks for the honour of\\r\\nyour note, I remain, dear Miss Crawford, etc., etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright, for\\r\\nshe found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence of receiving the note, was\\r\\ncoming towards her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot think I mean to hurry you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, in an undervoice,\\r\\nperceiving the amazing trepidation with which she made up the note, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\ncannot think I have any such object. Do not hurry yourself, I entreat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will be ready in a\\r\\nmoment; I am very much obliged to you; if you will be so good as to give\\r\\n_that_ to Miss Crawford.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe note was held out, and must be taken; and as she instantly and with\\r\\naverted eyes walked towards the fireplace, where sat the others, he had\\r\\nnothing to do but to go in good earnest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation, both of\\r\\npain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die\\r\\nwith the day; for every day would restore the knowledge of William's\\r\\nadvancement, whereas the pain, she hoped, would return no more. She had\\r\\nno doubt that her note must appear excessively ill-written, that\\r\\nthe language would disgrace a child, for her distress had allowed no\\r\\narrangement; but at least it would assure them both of her being neither\\r\\nimposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford's attentions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she awoke the next\\r\\nmorning; but she remembered the purport of her note, and was not less\\r\\nsanguine as to its effect than she had been the night before. If Mr.\\r\\nCrawford would but go away! That was what she most earnestly desired:\\r\\ngo and take his sister with him, as he was to do, and as he returned to\\r\\nMansfield on purpose to do. And why it was not done already she could\\r\\nnot devise, for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay. Fanny had\\r\\nhoped, in the course of his yesterday's visit, to hear the day named;\\r\\nbut he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere\\r\\nlong.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey,\\r\\nshe could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford, as she accidentally\\r\\ndid, coming up to the house again, and at an hour as early as the day\\r\\nbefore. His coming might have nothing to do with her, but she must avoid\\r\\nseeing him if possible; and being then on her way upstairs, she resolved\\r\\nthere to remain, during the whole of his visit, unless actually sent\\r\\nfor; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house, there seemed little\\r\\ndanger of her being wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat some time in a good deal of agitation, listening, trembling, and\\r\\nfearing to be sent for every moment; but as no footsteps approached the\\r\\nEast room, she grew gradually composed, could sit down, and be able to\\r\\nemploy herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and would go\\r\\nwithout her being obliged to know anything of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly half an hour had passed, and she was growing very comfortable,\\r\\nwhen suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard; a heavy\\r\\nstep, an unusual step in that part of the house: it was her uncle's; she\\r\\nknew it as well as his voice; she had trembled at it as often, and began\\r\\nto tremble again, at the idea of his coming up to speak to her, whatever\\r\\nmight be the subject. It was indeed Sir Thomas who opened the door and\\r\\nasked if she were there, and if he might come in. The terror of his\\r\\nformer occasional visits to that room seemed all renewed, and she felt\\r\\nas if he were going to examine her again in French and English.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was all attention, however, in placing a chair for him, and trying\\r\\nto appear honoured; and, in her agitation, had quite overlooked the\\r\\ndeficiencies of her apartment, till he, stopping short as he entered,\\r\\nsaid, with much surprise, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy have you no fire to-day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was snow on the ground, and she was sitting in a shawl. She\\r\\nhesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not cold, sir: I never sit here long at this time of year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you have a fire in general?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow comes this about? Here must be some mistake. I understood that you\\r\\nhad the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable.\\r\\nIn your bedchamber I know you _cannot_ have a fire. Here is some great\\r\\nmisapprehension which must be rectified. It is highly unfit for you to\\r\\nsit, be it only half an hour a day, without a fire. You are not strong.\\r\\nYou are chilly. Your aunt cannot be aware of this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged to speak, she\\r\\ncould not forbear, in justice to the aunt she loved best, from saying\\r\\nsomething in which the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy aunt Norris\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were distinguishable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI understand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried her uncle, recollecting himself, and not wanting\\r\\nto hear more: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI understand. Your aunt Norris has always been an\\r\\nadvocate, and very judiciously, for young people's being brought up\\r\\nwithout unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in\\r\\neverything. She is also very hardy herself, which of course will\\r\\ninfluence her in her opinion of the wants of others. And on another\\r\\naccount, too, I can perfectly comprehend. I know what her sentiments\\r\\nhave always been. The principle was good in itself, but it may have\\r\\nbeen, and I believe _has_ _been_, carried too far in your case. I\\r\\nam aware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaced\\r\\ndistinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you will\\r\\never harbour resentment on that account. You have an understanding\\r\\nwhich will prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judging\\r\\npartially by the event. You will take in the whole of the past, you\\r\\nwill consider times, persons, and probabilities, and you will feel that\\r\\n_they_ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you\\r\\nfor that mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot. Though\\r\\ntheir caution may prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant; and\\r\\nof this you may be assured, that every advantage of affluence will be\\r\\ndoubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been\\r\\nimposed. I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by failing\\r\\nat any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and attention\\r\\nthat are due to her. But enough of this. Sit down, my dear. I must speak\\r\\nto you for a few minutes, but I will not detain you long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny obeyed, with eyes cast down and colour rising. After a moment's\\r\\npause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress a smile, went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor this morning. I\\r\\nhad not been long in my own room, after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford was\\r\\nshewn in. His errand you may probably conjecture.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's colour grew deeper and deeper; and her uncle, perceiving that\\r\\nshe was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking\\r\\nup quite impossible, turned away his own eyes, and without any farther\\r\\npause proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford's visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Crawford's business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny,\\r\\nmake decided proposals for her, and entreat the sanction of the uncle,\\r\\nwho seemed to stand in the place of her parents; and he had done it all\\r\\nso well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas, feeling,\\r\\nmoreover, his own replies, and his own remarks to have been very much\\r\\nto the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their\\r\\nconversation; and little aware of what was passing in his niece's mind,\\r\\nconceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than\\r\\nhimself. He talked, therefore, for several minutes without Fanny's\\r\\ndaring to interrupt him. She had hardly even attained the wish to do it.\\r\\nHer mind was in too much confusion. She had changed her position; and,\\r\\nwith her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows, was listening to her\\r\\nuncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay. For a moment he ceased, but\\r\\nshe had barely become conscious of it, when, rising from his chair, he\\r\\nsaid, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Fanny, having performed one part of my commission,\\r\\nand shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and\\r\\nsatisfactory, I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to\\r\\naccompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot but presume on having\\r\\nbeen no unacceptable companion myself, I must submit to your finding\\r\\none still better worth listening to. Mr. Crawford, as you have perhaps\\r\\nforeseen, is yet in the house. He is in my room, and hoping to see you\\r\\nthere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this, which\\r\\nastonished Sir Thomas; but what was his increase of astonishment on\\r\\nhearing her exclaim--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! no, sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down to\\r\\nhim. Mr. Crawford ought to know--he must know that: I told him enough\\r\\nyesterday to convince him; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday,\\r\\nand I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me, and\\r\\nquite out of my power to return his good opinion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not catch your meaning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, sitting down again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut\\r\\nof your power to return his good opinion? What is all this? I know he\\r\\nspoke to you yesterday, and (as far as I understand) received as much\\r\\nencouragement to proceed as a well-judging young woman could permit\\r\\nherself to give. I was very much pleased with what I collected to have\\r\\nbeen your behaviour on the occasion; it shewed a discretion highly to\\r\\nbe commended. But now, when he has made his overtures so properly, and\\r\\nhonourably--what are your scruples _now_?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are mistaken, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety of the\\r\\nmoment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are quite\\r\\nmistaken. How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing? I gave him no\\r\\nencouragement yesterday. On the contrary, I told him, I cannot recollect\\r\\nmy exact words, but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him,\\r\\nthat it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and that I begged\\r\\nhim never to talk to me in that manner again. I am sure I said as much\\r\\nas that and more; and I should have said still more, if I had been quite\\r\\ncertain of his meaning anything seriously; but I did not like to be, I\\r\\ncould not bear to be, imputing more than might be intended. I thought it\\r\\nmight all pass for nothing with _him_.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could say no more; her breath was almost gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I to understand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, after a few moments' silence,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRefuse him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRefuse Mr. Crawford! Upon what plea? For what reason?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI--I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is very strange!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, in a voice of calm displeasure.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is something in this which my comprehension does not reach. Here\\r\\nis a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you, with everything to\\r\\nrecommend him: not merely situation in life, fortune, and character,\\r\\nbut with more than common agreeableness, with address and conversation\\r\\npleasing to everybody. And he is not an acquaintance of to-day; you have\\r\\nnow known him some time. His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend,\\r\\nand he has been doing _that_ for your brother, which I should suppose\\r\\nwould have been almost sufficient recommendation to you, had there been\\r\\nno other. It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William\\r\\non. He has done it already.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down with fresh shame;\\r\\nand she did feel almost ashamed of herself, after such a picture as her\\r\\nuncle had drawn, for not liking Mr. Crawford.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must have been aware,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Sir Thomas presently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou must\\r\\nhave been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford's manners\\r\\nto you. This cannot have taken you by surprise. You must have observed\\r\\nhis attentions; and though you always received them very properly (I\\r\\nhave no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them to be\\r\\nunpleasant to you. I am half inclined to think, Fanny, that you do not\\r\\nquite know your own feelings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes, sir! indeed I do. His attentions were always--what I did not\\r\\nlike.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is beyond me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis requires explanation. Young as you are, and having seen\\r\\nscarcely any one, it is hardly possible that your affections--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused and eyed her fixedly. He saw her lips formed into a _no_,\\r\\nthough the sound was inarticulate, but her face was like scarlet. That,\\r\\nhowever, in so modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence;\\r\\nand chusing at least to appear satisfied, he quickly added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, I\\r\\nknow _that_ is quite out of the question; quite impossible. Well, there\\r\\nis nothing more to be said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for a few minutes he did say nothing. He was deep in thought. His\\r\\nniece was deep in thought likewise, trying to harden and prepare herself\\r\\nagainst farther questioning. She would rather die than own the truth;\\r\\nand she hoped, by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyond\\r\\nbetraying it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndependently of the interest which Mr. Crawford's _choice_ seemed to\\r\\njustify\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chis\\r\\nwishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me. I am an\\r\\nadvocate for early marriages, where there are means in proportion, and\\r\\nwould have every young man, with a sufficient income, settle as soon\\r\\nafter four-and-twenty as he can. This is so much my opinion, that I am\\r\\nsorry to think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr.\\r\\nBertram, is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge,\\r\\nmatrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts. I wish he were more\\r\\nlikely to fix.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Here was a glance at Fanny. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEdmund, I consider, from\\r\\nhis dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early than\\r\\nhis brother. _He_, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he\\r\\ncould love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not. Am I right? Do\\r\\nyou agree with me, my dear?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was easy on the\\r\\nscore of the cousins. But the removal of his alarm did his niece\\r\\nno service: as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure\\r\\nincreased; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown, which\\r\\nFanny could picture to herself, though she dared not lift up her eyes,\\r\\nhe shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you any\\r\\nreason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford's temper?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to add, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut of his principles I have\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; but her heart sunk\\r\\nunder the appalling prospect of discussion, explanation, and probably\\r\\nnon-conviction. Her ill opinion of him was founded chiefly on\\r\\nobservations, which, for her cousins' sake, she could scarcely dare\\r\\nmention to their father. Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were so\\r\\nclosely implicated in Mr. Crawford's misconduct, that she could not give\\r\\nhis character, such as she believed it, without betraying them. She had\\r\\nhoped that, to a man like her uncle, so discerning, so honourable, so\\r\\ngood, the simple acknowledgment of settled _dislike_ on her side would\\r\\nhave been sufficient. To her infinite grief she found it was not.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling\\r\\nwretchedness, and with a good deal of cold sternness, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is of no\\r\\nuse, I perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this most\\r\\nmortifying conference. Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting. I\\r\\nwill, therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of\\r\\nyour conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed,\\r\\nand proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had\\r\\nsupposed. For I _had_, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have shewn,\\r\\nformed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to\\r\\nEngland. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper,\\r\\nself-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit which\\r\\nprevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which in young\\r\\nwomen is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence. But you\\r\\nhave now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you can and\\r\\nwill decide for yourself, without any consideration or deference for\\r\\nthose who have surely some right to guide you, without even asking their\\r\\nadvice. You have shewn yourself very, very different from anything that\\r\\nI had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of your family, of your\\r\\nparents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to have had a moment's\\r\\nshare in your thoughts on this occasion. How _they_ might be benefited,\\r\\nhow _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment for you, is nothing to\\r\\n_you_. You think only of yourself, and because you do not feel for Mr.\\r\\nCrawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for\\r\\nhappiness, you resolve to refuse him at once, without wishing even for\\r\\na little time to consider of it, a little more time for cool\\r\\nconsideration, and for really examining your own inclinations; and are,\\r\\nin a wild fit of folly, throwing away from you such an opportunity of\\r\\nbeing settled in life, eligibly, honourably, nobly settled, as will,\\r\\nprobably, never occur to you again. Here is a young man of sense, of\\r\\ncharacter, of temper, of manners, and of fortune, exceedingly attached\\r\\nto you, and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested\\r\\nway; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you may live eighteen years longer\\r\\nin the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford's\\r\\nestate, or a tenth part of his merits. Gladly would I have bestowed\\r\\neither of my own daughters on him. Maria is nobly married; but had\\r\\nMr. Crawford sought Julia's hand, I should have given it to him with\\r\\nsuperior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria's to Mr.\\r\\nRushworth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After half a moment's pause: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I should have been very\\r\\nmuch surprised had either of my daughters, on receiving a proposal\\r\\nof marriage at any time which might carry with it only _half_ the\\r\\neligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily, and without paying\\r\\nmy opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation, put a\\r\\ndecided negative on it. I should have been much surprised and much hurt\\r\\nby such a proceeding. I should have thought it a gross violation of duty\\r\\nand respect. _You_ are not to be judged by the same rule. You do not\\r\\nowe me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if your heart can acquit you of\\r\\n_ingratitude_--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ceased. Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that, angry as he\\r\\nwas, he would not press that article farther. Her heart was almost broke\\r\\nby such a picture of what she appeared to him; by such accusations,\\r\\nso heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation! Self-willed,\\r\\nobstinate, selfish, and ungrateful. He thought her all this. She had\\r\\ndeceived his expectations; she had lost his good opinion. What was to\\r\\nbecome of her?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she inarticulately, through her tears, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\nvery sorry indeed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably have reason to\\r\\nbe long sorry for this day's transactions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it were possible for me to do otherwise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, with another\\r\\nstrong effort; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make\\r\\nhim happy, and that I should be miserable myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother burst of tears; but in spite of that burst, and in spite of that\\r\\ngreat black word _miserable_, which served to introduce it, Sir Thomas\\r\\nbegan to think a little relenting, a little change of inclination, might\\r\\nhave something to do with it; and to augur favourably from the personal\\r\\nentreaty of the young man himself. He knew her to be very timid, and\\r\\nexceedingly nervous; and thought it not improbable that her mind\\r\\nmight be in such a state as a little time, a little pressing, a little\\r\\npatience, and a little impatience, a judicious mixture of all on the\\r\\nlover's side, might work their usual effect on. If the gentleman would\\r\\nbut persevere, if he had but love enough to persevere, Sir Thomas began\\r\\nto have hopes; and these reflections having passed across his mind and\\r\\ncheered it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less\\r\\nanger, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwell, child, dry up your tears. There is no use in these tears;\\r\\nthey can do no good. You must now come downstairs with me. Mr. Crawford\\r\\nhas been kept waiting too long already. You must give him your own\\r\\nanswer: we cannot expect him to be satisfied with less; and you only\\r\\ncan explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments,\\r\\nwhich, unfortunately for himself, he certainly has imbibed. I am totally\\r\\nunequal to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going down\\r\\nto him, that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it better\\r\\nto indulge her. His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small\\r\\ndepression in consequence; but when he looked at his niece, and saw the\\r\\nstate of feature and complexion which her crying had brought her\\r\\ninto, he thought there might be as much lost as gained by an immediate\\r\\ninterview. With a few words, therefore, of no particular meaning, he\\r\\nwalked off by himself, leaving his poor niece to sit and cry over what\\r\\nhad passed, with very wretched feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer mind was all disorder. The past, present, future, everything was\\r\\nterrible. But her uncle's anger gave her the severest pain of all.\\r\\nSelfish and ungrateful! to have appeared so to him! She was miserable\\r\\nfor ever. She had no one to take her part, to counsel, or speak for her.\\r\\nHer only friend was absent. He might have softened his father; but all,\\r\\nperhaps all, would think her selfish and ungrateful. She might have to\\r\\nendure the reproach again and again; she might hear it, or see it, or\\r\\nknow it to exist for ever in every connexion about her. She could not\\r\\nbut feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford; yet, if he really loved\\r\\nher, and were unhappy too! It was all wretchedness together.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned; she was almost\\r\\nready to faint at the sight of him. He spoke calmly, however, without\\r\\nausterity, without reproach, and she revived a little. There was\\r\\ncomfort, too, in his words, as well as his manner, for he began with,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Crawford is gone: he has just left me. I need not repeat what has\\r\\npassed. I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling, by an\\r\\naccount of what he has felt. Suffice it, that he has behaved in the\\r\\nmost gentlemanlike and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most\\r\\nfavourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and temper. Upon my\\r\\nrepresentation of what you were suffering, he immediately, and with the\\r\\ngreatest delicacy, ceased to urge to see you for the present.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued\\r\\nher uncle, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit cannot be supposed but that he should request to speak\\r\\nwith you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too natural,\\r\\na claim too just to be denied. But there is no time fixed; perhaps\\r\\nto-morrow, or whenever your spirits are composed enough. For the present\\r\\nyou have only to tranquillise yourself. Check these tears; they do but\\r\\nexhaust you. If, as I am willing to suppose, you wish to shew me any\\r\\nobservance, you will not give way to these emotions, but endeavour to\\r\\nreason yourself into a stronger frame of mind. I advise you to go out:\\r\\nthe air will do you good; go out for an hour on the gravel; you will\\r\\nhave the shrubbery to yourself, and will be the better for air and\\r\\nexercise. And, Fanny\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (turning back again for a moment), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall make\\r\\nno mention below of what has passed; I shall not even tell your aunt\\r\\nBertram. There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment; say\\r\\nnothing about it yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was an act of\\r\\nkindness which Fanny felt at her heart. To be spared from her aunt\\r\\nNorris's interminable reproaches! he left her in a glow of gratitude.\\r\\nAnything might be bearable rather than such reproaches. Even to see Mr.\\r\\nCrawford would be less overpowering.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked out directly, as her uncle recommended, and followed his\\r\\nadvice throughout, as far as she could; did check her tears; did\\r\\nearnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind. She wished\\r\\nto prove to him that she did desire his comfort, and sought to regain\\r\\nhis favour; and he had given her another strong motive for exertion, in\\r\\nkeeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts. Not to excite\\r\\nsuspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth attaining; and\\r\\nshe felt equal to almost anything that might save her from her aunt\\r\\nNorris.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her walk and going\\r\\ninto the East room again, the first thing which caught her eye was a\\r\\nfire lighted and burning. A fire! it seemed too much; just at that time\\r\\nto be giving her such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude.\\r\\nShe wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of such a\\r\\ntrifle again; but she soon found, from the voluntary information of the\\r\\nhousemaid, who came in to attend it, that so it was to be every day. Sir\\r\\nThomas had given orders for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, in\\r\\nsoliloquy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeaven defend me from being ungrateful!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw nothing more of her uncle, nor of her aunt Norris, till they met\\r\\nat dinner. Her uncle's behaviour to her was then as nearly as possible\\r\\nwhat it had been before; she was sure he did not mean there should be\\r\\nany change, and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy\\r\\nany; but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her; and when she found how\\r\\nmuch and how unpleasantly her having only walked out without her aunt's\\r\\nknowledge could be dwelt on, she felt all the reason she had to bless\\r\\nthe kindness which saved her from the same spirit of reproach, exerted\\r\\non a more momentous subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I had known you were going out, I should have got you just to go\\r\\nas far as my house with some orders for Nanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich I have\\r\\nsince, to my very great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carry\\r\\nmyself. I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved me the\\r\\ntrouble, if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were\\r\\ngoing out. It would have made no difference to you, I suppose, whether\\r\\nyou had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sir\\r\\nThomas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Norris, with a moment's check, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat was very kind of\\r\\nyou, Sir Thomas; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house.\\r\\nFanny would have had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with the\\r\\nadvantage of being of some use, and obliging her aunt: it is all her\\r\\nfault. If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is\\r\\na something about Fanny, I have often observed it before--she likes to\\r\\ngo her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takes\\r\\nher own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a little\\r\\nspirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which I\\r\\nwould advise her to get the better of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be\\r\\nmore unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments\\r\\nhimself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried repeatedly\\r\\nbefore he could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to\\r\\nperceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he thought\\r\\nwell of his niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have his own\\r\\nchildren's merits set off by the depreciation of hers. She was talking\\r\\n_at_ Fanny, and resenting this private walk half through the dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with more\\r\\ncomposure to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could\\r\\nhave hoped for after so stormy a morning; but she trusted, in the first\\r\\nplace, that she had done right: that her judgment had not misled her.\\r\\nFor the purity of her intentions she could answer; and she was willing\\r\\nto hope, secondly, that her uncle's displeasure was abating, and would\\r\\nabate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality, and\\r\\nfelt, as a good man must feel, how wretched, and how unpardonable, how\\r\\nhopeless, and how wicked it was to marry without affection.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past,\\r\\nshe could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally\\r\\nconcluded, and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield, that everything\\r\\nwould soon be as if no such subject had existed. She would not, could\\r\\nnot believe, that Mr. Crawford's affection for her could distress him\\r\\nlong; his mind was not of that sort. London would soon bring its cure.\\r\\nIn London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation, and be\\r\\nthankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil\\r\\nconsequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Fanny's mind was engaged in these sort of hopes, her uncle was,\\r\\nsoon after tea, called out of the room; an occurrence too common to\\r\\nstrike her, and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten\\r\\nminutes afterwards, and advancing decidedly towards herself, said,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas wishes to speak with you, ma'am, in his own room.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then it\\r\\noccurred to her what might be going on; a suspicion rushed over her mind\\r\\nwhich drove the colour from her cheeks; but instantly rising, she was\\r\\npreparing to obey, when Mrs. Norris called out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStay, stay, Fanny! what\\r\\nare you about? where are you going? don't be in such a hurry. Depend\\r\\nupon it, it is not you who are wanted; depend upon it, it is me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n (looking at the butler); \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you are so very eager to put yourself\\r\\nforward. What should Sir Thomas want you for? It is me, Baddeley, you\\r\\nmean; I am coming this moment. You mean me, Baddeley, I am sure; Sir\\r\\nThomas wants me, not Miss Price.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Baddeley was stout. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, ma'am, it is Miss Price; I am certain of\\r\\nits being Miss Price.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And there was a half-smile with the words, which\\r\\nmeant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not think you would answer the purpose at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose herself to work\\r\\nagain; and Fanny, walking off in agitating consciousness, found herself,\\r\\nas she anticipated, in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conference was neither so short nor so conclusive as the lady had\\r\\ndesigned. The gentleman was not so easily satisfied. He had all the\\r\\ndisposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him. He had vanity,\\r\\nwhich strongly inclined him in the first place to think she did love\\r\\nhim, though she might not know it herself; and which, secondly, when\\r\\nconstrained at last to admit that she did know her own present feelings,\\r\\nconvinced him that he should be able in time to make those feelings what\\r\\nhe wished.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which, operating\\r\\non an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than delicacy, made her\\r\\naffection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, and\\r\\ndetermined him to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing\\r\\nher to love him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe would not despair: he would not desist. He had every well-grounded\\r\\nreason for solid attachment; he knew her to have all the worth that\\r\\ncould justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her; her\\r\\nconduct at this very time, by speaking the disinterestedness and\\r\\ndelicacy of her character (qualities which he believed most rare\\r\\nindeed), was of a sort to heighten all his wishes, and confirm all his\\r\\nresolutions. He knew not that he had a pre-engaged heart to attack.\\r\\nOf _that_ he had no suspicion. He considered her rather as one who\\r\\nhad never thought on the subject enough to be in danger; who had been\\r\\nguarded by youth, a youth of mind as lovely as of person; whose modesty\\r\\nhad prevented her from understanding his attentions, and who was still\\r\\noverpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected, and the\\r\\nnovelty of a situation which her fancy had never taken into account.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust it not follow of course, that, when he was understood, he should\\r\\nsucceed? He believed it fully. Love such as his, in a man like himself,\\r\\nmust with perseverance secure a return, and at no great distance; and\\r\\nhe had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a very\\r\\nshort time, that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted. A little\\r\\ndifficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford. He rather\\r\\nderived spirits from it. He had been apt to gain hearts too easily. His\\r\\nsituation was new and animating.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her life to\\r\\nfind any charm in it, all this was unintelligible. She found that he did\\r\\nmean to persevere; but how he could, after such language from her as she\\r\\nfelt herself obliged to use, was not to be understood. She told him that\\r\\nshe did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never should love\\r\\nhim; that such a change was quite impossible; that the subject was most\\r\\npainful to her; that she must entreat him never to mention it again, to\\r\\nallow her to leave him at once, and let it be considered as concluded\\r\\nfor ever. And when farther pressed, had added, that in her opinion their\\r\\ndispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affection\\r\\nincompatible; and that they were unfitted for each other by nature,\\r\\neducation, and habit. All this she had said, and with the earnestness\\r\\nof sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he immediately denied there\\r\\nbeing anything uncongenial in their characters, or anything unfriendly\\r\\nin their situations; and positively declared, that he would still love,\\r\\nand still hope!\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny knew her own meaning, but was no judge of her own manner. Her\\r\\nmanner was incurably gentle; and she was not aware how much it concealed\\r\\nthe sternness of her purpose. Her diffidence, gratitude, and softness\\r\\nmade every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of\\r\\nself-denial; seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to herself\\r\\nas to him. Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as the\\r\\nclandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had been\\r\\nher abhorrence, whom she had hated to see or to speak to, in whom she\\r\\ncould believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of being\\r\\nagreeable, she had barely acknowledged. He was now the Mr. Crawford who\\r\\nwas addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love; whose feelings\\r\\nwere apparently become all that was honourable and upright, whose views\\r\\nof happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment; who was\\r\\npouring out his sense of her merits, describing and describing again his\\r\\naffection, proving as far as words could prove it, and in the language,\\r\\ntone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he sought her for her\\r\\ngentleness and her goodness; and to complete the whole, he was now the\\r\\nMr. Crawford who had procured William's promotion!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was a change, and here were claims which could not but operate!\\r\\nShe might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue, in\\r\\nthe grounds of Sotherton, or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but he\\r\\napproached her now with rights that demanded different treatment.\\r\\nShe must be courteous, and she must be compassionate. She must have\\r\\na sensation of being honoured, and whether thinking of herself or her\\r\\nbrother, she must have a strong feeling of gratitude. The effect of the\\r\\nwhole was a manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled with\\r\\nher refusal so expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper of\\r\\nvanity and hope like Crawford's, the truth, or at least the strength\\r\\nof her indifference, might well be questionable; and he was not so\\r\\nirrational as Fanny considered him, in the professions of persevering,\\r\\nassiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed the interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was with reluctance that he suffered her to go; but there was no look\\r\\nof despair in parting to belie his words, or give her hopes of his being\\r\\nless unreasonable than he professed himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow she was angry. Some resentment did arise at a perseverance so\\r\\nselfish and ungenerous. Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for\\r\\nothers which had formerly so struck and disgusted her. Here was again\\r\\na something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before.\\r\\nHow evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity where his\\r\\nown pleasure was concerned; and alas! how always known no principle to\\r\\nsupply as a duty what the heart was deficient in! Had her own affections\\r\\nbeen as free as perhaps they ought to have been, he never could have\\r\\nengaged them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she sat musing\\r\\nover that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wondering\\r\\nat the past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in a\\r\\nnervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of\\r\\nher being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, and\\r\\nthe felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas was obliged, or obliged himself, to wait till the morrow for\\r\\na knowledge of what had passed between the young people. He then saw\\r\\nMr. Crawford, and received his account. The first feeling was\\r\\ndisappointment: he had hoped better things; he had thought that an\\r\\nhour's entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so\\r\\nlittle change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny; but there was speedy\\r\\ncomfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover;\\r\\nand when seeing such confidence of success in the principal, Sir Thomas\\r\\nwas soon able to depend on it himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing was omitted, on his side, of civility, compliment, or kindness,\\r\\nthat might assist the plan. Mr. Crawford's steadiness was honoured, and\\r\\nFanny was praised, and the connexion was still the most desirable in the\\r\\nworld. At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he had\\r\\nonly to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of his\\r\\nvisits, at present or in future. In all his niece's family and friends,\\r\\nthere could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the influence\\r\\nof all who loved her must incline one way.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was said that could encourage, every encouragement received\\r\\nwith grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted the best of friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nSatisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and\\r\\nhopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity\\r\\nwith his niece, and to shew no open interference. Upon her disposition\\r\\nhe believed kindness might be the best way of working. Entreaty should\\r\\nbe from one quarter only. The forbearance of her family on a point,\\r\\nrespecting which she could be in no doubt of their wishes, might be\\r\\ntheir surest means of forwarding it. Accordingly, on this principle, Sir\\r\\nThomas took the first opportunity of saying to her, with a mild gravity,\\r\\nintended to be overcoming, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Fanny, I have seen Mr. Crawford again,\\r\\nand learn from him exactly how matters stand between you. He is a most\\r\\nextraordinary young man, and whatever be the event, you must feel that\\r\\nyou have created an attachment of no common character; though, young\\r\\nas you are, and little acquainted with the transient, varying, unsteady\\r\\nnature of love, as it generally exists, you cannot be struck as I\\r\\nam with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against\\r\\ndiscouragement. With him it is entirely a matter of feeling: he claims\\r\\nno merit in it; perhaps is entitled to none. Yet, having chosen so\\r\\nwell, his constancy has a respectable stamp. Had his choice been less\\r\\nunexceptionable, I should have condemned his persevering.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should\\r\\ncontinue to know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I\\r\\nfeel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I\\r\\nhave told him so, that it never will be in my power--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interrupted Sir Thomas, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is no occasion for this. Your\\r\\nfeelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be\\r\\nto you. There is nothing more to be said or done. From this hour the\\r\\nsubject is never to be revived between us. You will have nothing to\\r\\nfear, or to be agitated about. You cannot suppose me capable of trying\\r\\nto persuade you to marry against your inclinations. Your happiness and\\r\\nadvantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is required of you\\r\\nbut to bear with Mr. Crawford's endeavours to convince you that they may\\r\\nnot be incompatible with his. He proceeds at his own risk. You are on\\r\\nsafe ground. I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls, as\\r\\nyou might have done had nothing of this sort occurred. You will see\\r\\nhim with the rest of us, in the same manner, and, as much as you\\r\\ncan, dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant. He leaves\\r\\nNorthamptonshire so soon, that even this slight sacrifice cannot be\\r\\noften demanded. The future must be very uncertain. And now, my dear\\r\\nFanny, this subject is closed between us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much\\r\\nsatisfaction. Her uncle's kind expressions, however, and forbearing\\r\\nmanner, were sensibly felt; and when she considered how much of the\\r\\ntruth was unknown to him, she believed she had no right to wonder at\\r\\nthe line of conduct he pursued. He, who had married a daughter to Mr.\\r\\nRushworth: romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him.\\r\\nShe must do her duty, and trust that time might make her duty easier\\r\\nthan it now was.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford's attachment\\r\\nwould hold out for ever; she could not but imagine that steady,\\r\\nunceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time.\\r\\nHow much time she might, in her own fancy, allot for its dominion, is\\r\\nanother concern. It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady's\\r\\nexact estimate of her own perfections.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once more\\r\\nobliged to mention the subject to his niece, to prepare her briefly for\\r\\nits being imparted to her aunts; a measure which he would still have\\r\\navoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally\\r\\nopposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding. He\\r\\nhad no idea of concealment. It was all known at the Parsonage, where\\r\\nhe loved to talk over the future with both his sisters, and it would be\\r\\nrather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress\\r\\nof his success. When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt the necessity\\r\\nof making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business\\r\\nwithout delay; though, on Fanny's account, he almost dreaded the\\r\\neffect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself. He\\r\\ndeprecated her mistaken but well-meaning zeal. Sir Thomas, indeed, was,\\r\\nby this time, not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those\\r\\nwell-meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris, however, relieved him. He pressed for the strictest\\r\\nforbearance and silence towards their niece; she not only promised, but\\r\\ndid observe it. She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was:\\r\\nbitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received\\r\\nsuch an offer than for refusing it. It was an injury and affront to\\r\\nJulia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford's choice; and, independently\\r\\nof that, she disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her; and she\\r\\nwould have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always\\r\\ntrying to depress.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than she\\r\\ndeserved; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to see\\r\\nher displeasure, and not to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram took it differently. She had been a beauty, and a\\r\\nprosperous beauty, all her life; and beauty and wealth were all that\\r\\nexcited her respect. To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of\\r\\nfortune, raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion. By convincing\\r\\nher that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she had been doubting about\\r\\nbefore, and that she would be advantageously married, it made her feel a\\r\\nsort of credit in calling her niece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, as soon as they were alone together afterwards,\\r\\nand she really had known something like impatience to be alone with her,\\r\\nand her countenance, as she spoke, had extraordinary animation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\r\\nFanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning. I must just\\r\\nspeak of it _once_, I told Sir Thomas I must _once_, and then I\\r\\nshall have done. I give you joy, my dear niece.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And looking at her\\r\\ncomplacently, she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHumph, we certainly are a handsome family!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say; when, hoping to assail\\r\\nher on her vulnerable side, she presently answered--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear aunt, _you_ cannot wish me to do differently from what I have\\r\\ndone, I am sure. _You_ cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me,\\r\\nshould not you? Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear, I should not think of missing you, when such an offer as\\r\\nthis comes in your way. I could do very well without you, if you were\\r\\nmarried to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford. And you must be\\r\\naware, Fanny, that it is every young woman's duty to accept such a very\\r\\nunexceptionable offer as this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece of advice,\\r\\nwhich Fanny had ever received from her aunt in the course of eight years\\r\\nand a half. It silenced her. She felt how unprofitable contention would\\r\\nbe. If her aunt's feelings were against her, nothing could be hoped from\\r\\nattacking her understanding. Lady Bertram was quite talkative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will tell you what, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure he fell in love with\\r\\nyou at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening. You did\\r\\nlook remarkably well. Everybody said so. Sir Thomas said so. And you\\r\\nknow you had Chapman to help you to dress. I am very glad I sent\\r\\nChapman to you. I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done\\r\\nthat evening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she soon\\r\\nafterwards added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than I\\r\\ndid for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund had great things to hear on his return. Many surprises were\\r\\nawaiting him. The first that occurred was not least in interest: the\\r\\nappearance of Henry Crawford and his sister walking together through the\\r\\nvillage as he rode into it. He had concluded--he had meant them to be\\r\\nfar distant. His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely\\r\\nto avoid Miss Crawford. He was returning to Mansfield with spirits ready\\r\\nto feed on melancholy remembrances, and tender associations, when her\\r\\nown fair self was before him, leaning on her brother's arm, and he found\\r\\nhimself receiving a welcome, unquestionably friendly, from the woman\\r\\nwhom, two moments before, he had been thinking of as seventy miles off,\\r\\nand as farther, much farther, from him in inclination than any distance\\r\\ncould express.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hoped\\r\\nfor, had he expected to see her. Coming as he did from such a purport\\r\\nfulfilled as had taken him away, he would have expected anything rather\\r\\nthan a look of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning.\\r\\nIt was enough to set his heart in a glow, and to bring him home in the\\r\\nproperest state for feeling the full value of the other joyful surprises\\r\\nat hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam's promotion, with all its particulars, he was soon master of;\\r\\nand with such a secret provision of comfort within his own breast to\\r\\nhelp the joy, he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and\\r\\nunvarying cheerfulness all dinner-time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner, when he and his father were alone, he had Fanny's history;\\r\\nand then all the great events of the last fortnight, and the present\\r\\nsituation of matters at Mansfield were known to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny suspected what was going on. They sat so much longer than usual in\\r\\nthe dining-parlour, that she was sure they must be talking of her; and\\r\\nwhen tea at last brought them away, and she was to be seen by Edmund\\r\\nagain, she felt dreadfully guilty. He came to her, sat down by her, took\\r\\nher hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment she thought that,\\r\\nbut for the occupation and the scene which the tea-things afforded, she\\r\\nmust have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable excess.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not intending, however, by such action, to be conveying to her\\r\\nthat unqualified approbation and encouragement which her hopes drew\\r\\nfrom it. It was designed only to express his participation in all that\\r\\ninterested her, and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened\\r\\nevery feeling of affection. He was, in fact, entirely on his father's\\r\\nside of the question. His surprise was not so great as his father's at\\r\\nher refusing Crawford, because, so far from supposing her to consider\\r\\nhim with anything like a preference, he had always believed it to\\r\\nbe rather the reverse, and could imagine her to be taken perfectly\\r\\nunprepared, but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more\\r\\ndesirable than he did. It had every recommendation to him; and while\\r\\nhonouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present\\r\\nindifference, honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas\\r\\ncould quite echo, he was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine in\\r\\nbelieving, that it would be a match at last, and that, united by mutual\\r\\naffection, it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly\\r\\nfitted to make them blessed in each other, as he was now beginning\\r\\nseriously to consider them. Crawford had been too precipitate. He had\\r\\nnot given her time to attach herself. He had begun at the wrong end.\\r\\nWith such powers as his, however, and such a disposition as hers, Edmund\\r\\ntrusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion. Meanwhile,\\r\\nhe saw enough of Fanny's embarrassment to make him scrupulously guard\\r\\nagainst exciting it a second time, by any word, or look, or movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund's return, Sir\\r\\nThomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner; it was\\r\\nreally a necessary compliment. He staid of course, and Edmund had then\\r\\nample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what degree\\r\\nof immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her manners;\\r\\nand it was so little, so very, very little--every chance, every\\r\\npossibility of it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there was\\r\\nnot hope in her confusion, there was hope in nothing else--that he was\\r\\nalmost ready to wonder at his friend's perseverance. Fanny was worth it\\r\\nall; he held her to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion of\\r\\nmind, but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any woman\\r\\nbreathing, without something more to warm his courage than his eyes\\r\\ncould discern in hers. He was very willing to hope that Crawford saw\\r\\nclearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friend\\r\\nthat he could come to from all that he observed to pass before, and at,\\r\\nand after dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more\\r\\npromising. When he and Crawford walked into the drawing-room, his mother\\r\\nand Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there\\r\\nwere nothing else to care for. Edmund could not help noticing their\\r\\napparently deep tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have not been so silent all the time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied his mother. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFanny\\r\\nhas been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you\\r\\ncoming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air\\r\\nof being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe often\\r\\nreads to me out of those books; and she was in the middle of a very\\r\\nfine speech of that man's--what's his name, Fanny?--when we heard your\\r\\nfootsteps.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCrawford took the volume. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me have the pleasure of finishing that\\r\\nspeech to your ladyship,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall find it immediately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And by\\r\\ncarefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves, he did find it,\\r\\nor within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram, who\\r\\nassured him, as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey, that\\r\\nhe had got the very speech. Not a look or an offer of help had Fanny\\r\\ngiven; not a syllable for or against. All her attention was for her\\r\\nwork. She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But taste\\r\\nwas too strong in her. She could not abstract her mind five minutes: she\\r\\nwas forced to listen; his reading was capital, and her pleasure in good\\r\\nreading extreme. To _good_ reading, however, she had been long used:\\r\\nher uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well, but in Mr.\\r\\nCrawford's reading there was a variety of excellence beyond what she had\\r\\never met with. The King, the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey, Cromwell, all\\r\\nwere given in turn; for with the happiest knack, the happiest power of\\r\\njumping and guessing, he could always alight at will on the best scene,\\r\\nor the best speeches of each; and whether it were dignity, or pride, or\\r\\ntenderness, or remorse, or whatever were to be expressed, he could do\\r\\nit with equal beauty. It was truly dramatic. His acting had first taught\\r\\nFanny what pleasure a play might give, and his reading brought all his\\r\\nacting before her again; nay, perhaps with greater enjoyment, for it\\r\\ncame unexpectedly, and with no such drawback as she had been used to\\r\\nsuffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss Bertram.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund watched the progress of her attention, and was amused and\\r\\ngratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework, which\\r\\nat the beginning seemed to occupy her totally: how it fell from her hand\\r\\nwhile she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes which had\\r\\nappeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and\\r\\nfixed on Crawford--fixed on him for minutes, fixed on him, in short,\\r\\ntill the attraction drew Crawford's upon her, and the book was closed,\\r\\nand the charm was broken. Then she was shrinking again into herself,\\r\\nand blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been enough to give\\r\\nEdmund encouragement for his friend, and as he cordially thanked him, he\\r\\nhoped to be expressing Fanny's secret feelings too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat play must be a favourite with you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou read as if you\\r\\nknew it well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will be a favourite, I believe, from this hour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Crawford;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before\\r\\nsince I was fifteen. I once saw Henry the Eighth acted, or I have heard\\r\\nof it from somebody who did, I am not certain which. But Shakespeare\\r\\none gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part of an\\r\\nEnglishman's constitution. His thoughts and beauties are so spread\\r\\nabroad that one touches them everywhere; one is intimate with him by\\r\\ninstinct. No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his\\r\\nplays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom one's earliest years. His celebrated passages are quoted\\r\\nby everybody; they are in half the books we open, and we all talk\\r\\nShakespeare, use his similes, and describe with his descriptions; but\\r\\nthis is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it. To know\\r\\nhim in bits and scraps is common enough; to know him pretty thoroughly\\r\\nis, perhaps, not uncommon; but to read him well aloud is no everyday\\r\\ntalent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSir, you do me honour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was Crawford's answer, with a bow of mock\\r\\ngravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word of accordant\\r\\npraise could be extorted from her; yet both feeling that it could not\\r\\nbe. Her praise had been given in her attention; _that_ must content\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Bertram's admiration was expressed, and strongly too. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was\\r\\nreally like being at a play,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish Sir Thomas had been\\r\\nhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCrawford was excessively pleased. If Lady Bertram, with all her\\r\\nincompetency and languor, could feel this, the inference of what her\\r\\nniece, alive and enlightened as she was, must feel, was elevating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said her\\r\\nladyship soon afterwards; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I will tell you what, I think you will\\r\\nhave a theatre, some time or other, at your house in Norfolk. I mean\\r\\nwhen you are settled there. I do indeed. I think you will fit up a\\r\\ntheatre at your house in Norfolk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you, ma'am?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried he, with quickness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no, that will never be.\\r\\nYour ladyship is quite mistaken. No theatre at Everingham! Oh no!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And\\r\\nhe looked at Fanny with an expressive smile, which evidently meant,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined _not_ to see it, as to\\r\\nmake it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of\\r\\nthe protestation; and such a quick consciousness of compliment, such a\\r\\nready comprehension of a hint, he thought, was rather favourable than\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject of reading aloud was farther discussed. The two young men\\r\\nwere the only talkers, but they, standing by the fire, talked over the\\r\\ntoo common neglect of the qualification, the total inattention to it,\\r\\nin the ordinary school-system for boys, the consequently natural, yet in\\r\\nsome instances almost unnatural, degree of ignorance and uncouthness\\r\\nof men, of sensible and well-informed men, when suddenly called to the\\r\\nnecessity of reading aloud, which had fallen within their notice, giving\\r\\ninstances of blunders, and failures with their secondary causes, the\\r\\nwant of management of the voice, of proper modulation and emphasis, of\\r\\nforesight and judgment, all proceeding from the first cause: want of\\r\\nearly attention and habit; and Fanny was listening again with great\\r\\nentertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven in my profession,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Edmund, with a smile, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow little the\\r\\nart of reading has been studied! how little a clear manner, and good\\r\\ndelivery, have been attended to! I speak rather of the past, however,\\r\\nthan the present. There is now a spirit of improvement abroad; but among\\r\\nthose who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago, the larger\\r\\nnumber, to judge by their performance, must have thought reading was\\r\\nreading, and preaching was preaching. It is different now. The subject\\r\\nis more justly considered. It is felt that distinctness and energy may\\r\\nhave weight in recommending the most solid truths; and besides, there is\\r\\nmore general observation and taste, a more critical knowledge diffused\\r\\nthan formerly; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who\\r\\nknow a little of the matter, and who can judge and criticise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination;\\r\\nand upon this being understood, he had a variety of questions from\\r\\nCrawford as to his feelings and success; questions, which being made,\\r\\nthough with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without\\r\\nany touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew to\\r\\nbe most offensive to Fanny, he had true pleasure in satisfying; and\\r\\nwhen Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the\\r\\nproperest manner in which particular passages in the service should be\\r\\ndelivered, shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before,\\r\\nand thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and more pleased. This\\r\\nwould be the way to Fanny's heart. She was not to be won by all that\\r\\ngallantry and wit and good-nature together could do; or, at least,\\r\\nshe would not be won by them nearly so soon, without the assistance of\\r\\nsentiment and feeling, and seriousness on serious subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur liturgy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed Crawford, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas beauties, which not even a\\r\\ncareless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; but it has also\\r\\nredundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt.\\r\\nFor myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I\\r\\nought to be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (here was a glance at Fanny); \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat nineteen times out of\\r\\ntwenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to\\r\\nhave it to read myself. Did you speak?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stepping eagerly to Fanny, and\\r\\naddressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied you\\r\\nmight be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not _allow_\\r\\nmy thoughts to wander. Are not you going to tell me so?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to--even supposing--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopt, felt herself getting into a puzzle, and could not be\\r\\nprevailed on to add another word, not by dint of several minutes of\\r\\nsupplication and waiting. He then returned to his former station, and\\r\\nwent on as if there had been no such tender interruption.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than prayers well read.\\r\\nA sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing. It is more difficult\\r\\nto speak well than to compose well; that is, the rules and trick of\\r\\ncomposition are oftener an object of study. A thoroughly good sermon,\\r\\nthoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification. I can never hear\\r\\nsuch a one without the greatest admiration and respect, and more than\\r\\nhalf a mind to take orders and preach myself. There is something in the\\r\\neloquence of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitled\\r\\nto the highest praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and affect\\r\\nsuch an heterogeneous mass of hearers, on subjects limited, and long\\r\\nworn threadbare in all common hands; who can say anything new or\\r\\nstriking, anything that rouses the attention without offending the\\r\\ntaste, or wearing out the feelings of his hearers, is a man whom one\\r\\ncould not, in his public capacity, honour enough. I should like to be\\r\\nsuch a man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should indeed. I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my\\r\\nlife without a sort of envy. But then, I must have a London audience.\\r\\nI could not preach but to the educated; to those who were capable of\\r\\nestimating my composition. And I do not know that I should be fond of\\r\\npreaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring,\\r\\nafter being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but\\r\\nnot for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her head,\\r\\nand Crawford was instantly by her side again, entreating to know her\\r\\nmeaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his drawing in a chair, and sitting\\r\\ndown close by her, that it was to be a very thorough attack, that looks\\r\\nand undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly as possible\\r\\ninto a corner, turned his back, and took up a newspaper, very sincerely\\r\\nwishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away\\r\\nthat shake of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover; and as\\r\\nearnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in\\r\\nmurmurs of his own, over the various advertisements of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA most desirable\\r\\nEstate in South Wales\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo Parents and Guardians\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCapital\\r\\nseason'd Hunter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless\\r\\nas she was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund's\\r\\narrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her modest,\\r\\ngentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and\\r\\ninquiries; and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did that shake of the head mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat was it meant to\\r\\nexpress? Disapprobation, I fear. But of what? What had I been saying\\r\\nto displease you? Did you think me speaking improperly, lightly,\\r\\nirreverently on the subject? Only tell me if I was. Only tell me if\\r\\nI was wrong. I want to be set right. Nay, nay, I entreat you; for one\\r\\nmoment put down your work. What did that shake of the head mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain was her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPray, sir, don't; pray, Mr. Crawford,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d repeated twice\\r\\nover; and in vain did she try to move away. In the same low, eager\\r\\nvoice, and the same close neighbourhood, he went on, reurging the same\\r\\nquestions as before. She grew more agitated and displeased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can you, sir? You quite astonish me; I wonder how you can--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo I astonish you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you wonder? Is there anything in\\r\\nmy present entreaty that you do not understand? I will explain to you\\r\\ninstantly all that makes me urge you in this manner, all that gives me\\r\\nan interest in what you look and do, and excites my present curiosity. I\\r\\nwill not leave you to wonder long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of herself, she could not help half a smile, but she said\\r\\nnothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to\\r\\nengage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy. Yes, that\\r\\nwas the word. Constancy: I am not afraid of the word. I would spell it,\\r\\nread it, write it with anybody. I see nothing alarming in the word. Did\\r\\nyou think I ought?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, wearied at last into speaking--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps,\\r\\nsir, I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as\\r\\nyou seemed to do at that moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCrawford, delighted to get her to speak at any rate, was determined\\r\\nto keep it up; and poor Fanny, who had hoped to silence him by such an\\r\\nextremity of reproof, found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was only\\r\\na change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another.\\r\\nHe had always something to entreat the explanation of. The opportunity\\r\\nwas too fair. None such had occurred since his seeing her in her uncle's\\r\\nroom, none such might occur again before his leaving Mansfield. Lady\\r\\nBertram's being just on the other side of the table was a trifle,\\r\\nfor she might always be considered as only half-awake, and Edmund's\\r\\nadvertisements were still of the first utility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Crawford, after a course of rapid questions and reluctant\\r\\nanswers; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am happier than I was, because I now understand more clearly\\r\\nyour opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed by the whim of\\r\\nthe moment, easily tempted, easily put aside. With such an opinion, no\\r\\nwonder that. But we shall see. It is not by protestations that I shall\\r\\nendeavour to convince you I am wronged; it is not by telling you that my\\r\\naffections are steady. My conduct shall speak for me; absence, distance,\\r\\ntime shall speak for me. _They_ shall prove that, as far as you can be\\r\\ndeserved by anybody, I do deserve you. You are infinitely my superior\\r\\nin merit; all _that_ I know. You have qualities which I had not before\\r\\nsupposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature. You have some\\r\\ntouches of the angel in you beyond what--not merely beyond what one\\r\\nsees, because one never sees anything like it--but beyond what one\\r\\nfancies might be. But still I am not frightened. It is not by equality\\r\\nof merit that you can be won. That is out of the question. It is he\\r\\nwho sees and worships your merit the strongest, who loves you most\\r\\ndevotedly, that has the best right to a return. There I build my\\r\\nconfidence. By that right I do and will deserve you; and when once\\r\\nconvinced that my attachment is what I declare it, I know you too well\\r\\nnot to entertain the warmest hopes. Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n (seeing her draw back displeased), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforgive me. Perhaps I have as yet\\r\\nno right; but by what other name can I call you? Do you suppose you are\\r\\never present to my imagination under any other? No, it is 'Fanny' that\\r\\nI think of all day, and dream of all night. You have given the name such\\r\\nreality of sweetness, that nothing else can now be descriptive of you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer, or have refrained from\\r\\nat least trying to get away in spite of all the too public opposition\\r\\nshe foresaw to it, had it not been for the sound of approaching relief,\\r\\nthe very sound which she had been long watching for, and long thinking\\r\\nstrangely delayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solemn procession, headed by Baddeley, of tea-board, urn, and\\r\\ncake-bearers, made its appearance, and delivered her from a grievous\\r\\nimprisonment of body and mind. Mr. Crawford was obliged to move. She was\\r\\nat liberty, she was busy, she was protected.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those who\\r\\nmight speak and hear. But though the conference had seemed full long to\\r\\nhim, and though on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation,\\r\\nhe inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened\\r\\nto without some profit to the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXV\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse\\r\\nwhether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned\\r\\nbetween them or not; and that if she did not lead the way, it should\\r\\nnever be touched on by him; but after a day or two of mutual reserve, he\\r\\nwas induced by his father to change his mind, and try what his influence\\r\\nmight do for his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for the Crawfords'\\r\\ndeparture; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one\\r\\nmore effort for the young man before he left Mansfield, that all his\\r\\nprofessions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to\\r\\nsustain them as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr.\\r\\nCrawford's character in that point. He wished him to be a model of\\r\\nconstancy; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not\\r\\ntrying him too long.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; he\\r\\nwanted to know Fanny's feelings. She had been used to consult him in\\r\\nevery difficulty, and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her\\r\\nconfidence now; he hoped to be of service to her, he thought he must be\\r\\nof service to her; whom else had she to open her heart to? If she did\\r\\nnot need counsel, she must need the comfort of communication. Fanny\\r\\nestranged from him, silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of\\r\\nthings; a state which he must break through, and which he could easily\\r\\nlearn to think she was wanting him to break through.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will speak to her, sir: I will take the first opportunity of speaking\\r\\nto her alone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the result of such thoughts as these; and upon Sir\\r\\nThomas's information of her being at that very time walking alone in the\\r\\nshrubbery, he instantly joined her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am come to walk with you, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Drawing her\\r\\narm within his. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk\\r\\ntogether.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe assented to it all rather by look than word. Her spirits were low.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he presently added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin order to have a comfortable walk,\\r\\nsomething more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together. You\\r\\nmust talk to me. I know you have something on your mind. I know what you\\r\\nare thinking of. You cannot suppose me uninformed. Am I to hear of it\\r\\nfrom everybody but Fanny herself?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, at once agitated and dejected, replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you hear of it from\\r\\neverybody, cousin, there can be nothing for me to tell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny. No one but you can tell\\r\\nme them. I do not mean to press you, however. If it is not what you wish\\r\\nyourself, I have done. I had thought it might be a relief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in\\r\\ntalking of what I feel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you suppose that we think differently? I have no idea of it. I dare\\r\\nsay that, on a comparison of our opinions, they would be found as much\\r\\nalike as they have been used to be: to the point--I consider Crawford's\\r\\nproposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could return his\\r\\naffection. I consider it as most natural that all your family should\\r\\nwish you could return it; but that, as you cannot, you have done exactly\\r\\nas you ought in refusing him. Can there be any disagreement between us\\r\\nhere?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no! But I thought you blamed me. I thought you were against me. This\\r\\nis such a comfort!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you sought it. But\\r\\nhow could you possibly suppose me against you? How could you imagine me\\r\\nan advocate for marriage without love? Were I even careless in general\\r\\non such matters, how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at\\r\\nstake?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been talking to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right. I may be\\r\\nsorry, I may be surprised--though hardly _that_, for you had not had\\r\\ntime to attach yourself--but I think you perfectly right. Can it admit\\r\\nof a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love him;\\r\\nnothing could have justified your accepting him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistaken\\r\\nwho wished you to do otherwise. But the matter does not end here.\\r\\nCrawford's is no common attachment; he perseveres, with the hope of\\r\\ncreating that regard which had not been created before. This, we know,\\r\\nmust be a work of time. But\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (with an affectionate smile) \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet him\\r\\nsucceed at last, Fanny, let him succeed at last. You have proved\\r\\nyourself upright and disinterested, prove yourself grateful and\\r\\ntender-hearted; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which\\r\\nI have always believed you born for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! never, never, never! he never will succeed with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And she spoke\\r\\nwith a warmth which quite astonished Edmund, and which she blushed at\\r\\nthe recollection of herself, when she saw his look, and heard him\\r\\nreply, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever! Fanny!--so very determined and positive! This is not like\\r\\nyourself, your rational self.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, sorrowfully correcting herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I _think_ I\\r\\nnever shall, as far as the future can be answered for; I think I never\\r\\nshall return his regard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must hope better things. I am aware, more aware than Crawford can be,\\r\\nthat the man who means to make you love him (you having due notice of\\r\\nhis intentions) must have very uphill work, for there are all your early\\r\\nattachments and habits in battle array; and before he can get your heart\\r\\nfor his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things\\r\\nanimate and inanimate, which so many years' growth have confirmed, and\\r\\nwhich are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea\\r\\nof separation. I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit\\r\\nMansfield will for a time be arming you against him. I wish he had not\\r\\nbeen obliged to tell you what he was trying for. I wish he had known you\\r\\nas well as I do, Fanny. Between us, I think we should have won you. My\\r\\ntheoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed.\\r\\nHe should have worked upon my plans. I must hope, however, that time,\\r\\nproving him (as I firmly believe it will) to deserve you by his steady\\r\\naffection, will give him his reward. I cannot suppose that you have not\\r\\nthe _wish_ to love him--the natural wish of gratitude. You must have\\r\\nsome feeling of that sort. You must be sorry for your own indifference.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are so totally unlike,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, avoiding a direct answer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\r\\nare so very, very different in all our inclinations and ways, that\\r\\nI consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy\\r\\ntogether, even if I _could_ like him. There never were two people more\\r\\ndissimilar. We have not one taste in common. We should be miserable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are mistaken, Fanny. The dissimilarity is not so strong. You are\\r\\nquite enough alike. You _have_ tastes in common. You have moral and\\r\\nliterary tastes in common. You have both warm hearts and benevolent\\r\\nfeelings; and, Fanny, who that heard him read, and saw you listen to\\r\\nShakespeare the other night, will think you unfitted as companions? You\\r\\nforget yourself: there is a decided difference in your tempers, I allow.\\r\\nHe is lively, you are serious; but so much the better: his spirits will\\r\\nsupport yours. It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy\\r\\ndifficulties greater than they are. His cheerfulness will counteract\\r\\nthis. He sees difficulties nowhere: and his pleasantness and gaiety will\\r\\nbe a constant support to you. Your being so far unlike, Fanny, does not\\r\\nin the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness\\r\\ntogether: do not imagine it. I am myself convinced that it is rather a\\r\\nfavourable circumstance. I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers\\r\\nhad better be unlike: I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits, in\\r\\nthe manners, in the inclination for much or little company, in the\\r\\npropensity to talk or to be silent, to be grave or to be gay. Some\\r\\nopposition here is, I am thoroughly convinced, friendly to matrimonial\\r\\nhappiness. I exclude extremes, of course; and a very close resemblance\\r\\nin all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme.\\r\\nA counteraction, gentle and continual, is the best safeguard of manners\\r\\nand conduct.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFull well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now: Miss Crawford's\\r\\npower was all returning. He had been speaking of her cheerfully from the\\r\\nhour of his coming home. His avoiding her was quite at an end. He had\\r\\ndined at the Parsonage only the preceding day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes, Fanny,\\r\\nfeeling it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\r\\nis not merely in _temper_ that I consider him as totally unsuited to\\r\\nmyself; though, in _that_ respect, I think the difference between us too\\r\\ngreat, infinitely too great: his spirits often oppress me; but there is\\r\\nsomething in him which I object to still more. I must say, cousin, that\\r\\nI cannot approve his character. I have not thought well of him from the\\r\\ntime of the play. I then saw him behaving, as it appeared to me, so\\r\\nvery improperly and unfeelingly--I may speak of it now because it is all\\r\\nover--so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care how he\\r\\nexposed or hurt him, and paying attentions to my cousin Maria, which--in\\r\\nshort, at the time of the play, I received an impression which will\\r\\nnever be got over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her to the end, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet\\r\\nus not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period of\\r\\ngeneral folly. The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect.\\r\\nMaria was wrong, Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong together; but\\r\\nnone so wrong as myself. Compared with me, all the rest were blameless.\\r\\nI was playing the fool with my eyes open.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a bystander,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps I saw more than you did; and I do\\r\\nthink that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more improper than the whole\\r\\nbusiness. I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of\\r\\nit; but, if she could undertake the part, we must not be surprised at\\r\\nthe rest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBefore the play, I am much mistaken if _Julia_ did not think he was\\r\\npaying her attentions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJulia! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with\\r\\nJulia; but I could never see anything of it. And, Fanny, though I hope I\\r\\ndo justice to my sisters' good qualities, I think it very possible that\\r\\nthey might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired by Crawford,\\r\\nand might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly\\r\\nprudent. I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society;\\r\\nand with such encouragement, a man like Crawford, lively, and it may\\r\\nbe, a little unthinking, might be led on to--there could be nothing very\\r\\nstriking, because it is clear that he had no pretensions: his heart was\\r\\nreserved for you. And I must say, that its being for you has raised him\\r\\ninconceivably in my opinion. It does him the highest honour; it shews\\r\\nhis proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure\\r\\nattachment. It proves him unspoilt by his uncle. It proves him, in\\r\\nshort, everything that I had been used to wish to believe him, and\\r\\nfeared he was not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am persuaded that he does not think, as he ought, on serious\\r\\nsubjects.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay, rather, that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects,\\r\\nwhich I believe to be a good deal the case. How could it be otherwise,\\r\\nwith such an education and adviser? Under the disadvantages, indeed,\\r\\nwhich both have had, is it not wonderful that they should be what they\\r\\nare? Crawford's _feelings_, I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto\\r\\nbeen too much his guides. Happily, those feelings have generally been\\r\\ngood. You will supply the rest; and a most fortunate man he is to attach\\r\\nhimself to such a creature--to a woman who, firm as a rock in her own\\r\\nprinciples, has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend\\r\\nthem. He has chosen his partner, indeed, with rare felicity. He will\\r\\nmake you happy, Fanny; I know he will make you happy; but you will make\\r\\nhim everything.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would not engage in such a charge,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Fanny, in a shrinking\\r\\naccent; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin such an office of high responsibility!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs usual, believing yourself unequal to anything! fancying everything\\r\\ntoo much for you! Well, though I may not be able to persuade you into\\r\\ndifferent feelings, you will be persuaded into them, I trust. I confess\\r\\nmyself sincerely anxious that you may. I have no common interest in\\r\\nCrawford's well-doing. Next to your happiness, Fanny, his has the first\\r\\nclaim on me. You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say; and they walked\\r\\non together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction. Edmund\\r\\nfirst began again--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday,\\r\\nparticularly pleased, because I had not depended upon her seeing\\r\\neverything in so just a light. I knew she was very fond of you; but yet\\r\\nI was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as\\r\\nit deserved, and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on\\r\\nsome woman of distinction or fortune. I was afraid of the bias of those\\r\\nworldly maxims, which she has been too much used to hear. But it was\\r\\nvery different. She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought. She desires\\r\\nthe connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself. We had a long talk\\r\\nabout it. I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxious\\r\\nto know her sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutes\\r\\nbefore she began introducing it with all that openness of heart, and\\r\\nsweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are so\\r\\nmuch a part of herself. Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas Mrs. Grant in the room, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by\\r\\nthemselves; and when once we had begun, we had not done with you, Fanny,\\r\\ntill Crawford and Dr. Grant came in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best. You will see her,\\r\\nhowever, before she goes. She is very angry with you, Fanny; you must be\\r\\nprepared for that. She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine her\\r\\nanger. It is the regret and disappointment of a sister, who thinks her\\r\\nbrother has a right to everything he may wish for, at the first moment.\\r\\nShe is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and esteems you\\r\\nwith all her heart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew she would be very angry with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dearest Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer to him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo\\r\\nnot let the idea of her anger distress you. It is anger to be talked\\r\\nof rather than felt. Her heart is made for love and kindness, not for\\r\\nresentment. I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise;\\r\\nI wish you could have seen her countenance, when she said that you\\r\\n_should_ be Henry's wife. And I observed that she always spoke of you\\r\\nas 'Fanny,' which she was never used to do; and it had a sound of most\\r\\nsisterly cordiality.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd Mrs. Grant, did she say--did she speak; was she there all the\\r\\ntime?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, she was agreeing exactly with her sister. The surprise of your\\r\\nrefusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded. That you could refuse such\\r\\na man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand. I said what\\r\\nI could for you; but in good truth, as they stated the case--you must\\r\\nprove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different\\r\\nconduct; nothing else will satisfy them. But this is teasing you. I have\\r\\ndone. Do not turn away from me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI _should_ have thought,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, after a pause of recollection and\\r\\nexertion, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat every woman must have felt the possibility of a man's\\r\\nnot being approved, not being loved by some one of her sex at least, let\\r\\nhim be ever so generally agreeable. Let him have all the perfections\\r\\nin the world, I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man\\r\\nmust be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself. But,\\r\\neven supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims\\r\\nwhich his sisters think he has, how was I to be prepared to meet him\\r\\nwith any feeling answerable to his own? He took me wholly by surprise.\\r\\nI had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning; and\\r\\nsurely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was\\r\\ntaking what seemed very idle notice of me. In my situation, it would\\r\\nhave been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr.\\r\\nCrawford. I am sure his sisters, rating him as they do, must have\\r\\nthought it so, supposing he had meant nothing. How, then, was I to\\r\\nbe--to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me? How was I\\r\\nto have an attachment at his service, as soon as it was asked for? His\\r\\nsisters should consider me as well as him. The higher his deserts, the\\r\\nmore improper for me ever to have thought of him. And, and--we think\\r\\nvery differently of the nature of women, if they can imagine a woman so\\r\\nvery soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth. I know this to be the truth;\\r\\nand most worthy of you are such feelings. I had attributed them to you\\r\\nbefore. I thought I could understand you. You have now given exactly\\r\\nthe explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs.\\r\\nGrant, and they were both better satisfied, though your warm-hearted\\r\\nfriend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her\\r\\nfondness for Henry. I told them that you were of all human creatures the\\r\\none over whom habit had most power and novelty least; and that the very\\r\\ncircumstance of the novelty of Crawford's addresses was against him.\\r\\nTheir being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour; that you\\r\\ncould tolerate nothing that you were not used to; and a great deal more\\r\\nto the same purpose, to give them a knowledge of your character. Miss\\r\\nCrawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother.\\r\\nShe meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time,\\r\\nand of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten\\r\\nyears' happy marriage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for. Her\\r\\nfeelings were all in revolt. She feared she had been doing wrong: saying\\r\\ntoo much, overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary;\\r\\nin guarding against one evil, laying herself open to another; and to\\r\\nhave Miss Crawford's liveliness repeated to her at such a moment, and on\\r\\nsuch a subject, was a bitter aggravation.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund saw weariness and distress in her face, and immediately resolved\\r\\nto forbear all farther discussion; and not even to mention the name\\r\\nof Crawford again, except as it might be connected with what _must_ be\\r\\nagreeable to her. On this principle, he soon afterwards observed--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\r\\ngo on Monday. You are sure, therefore, of seeing your friend either\\r\\nto-morrow or Sunday. They really go on Monday; and I was within a trifle\\r\\nof being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day! I had almost\\r\\npromised it. What a difference it might have made! Those five or six\\r\\ndays more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were near staying there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery. I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly consented. Had I\\r\\nreceived any letter from Mansfield, to tell me how you were all going\\r\\non, I believe I should certainly have staid; but I knew nothing that\\r\\nhad happened here for a fortnight, and felt that I had been away long\\r\\nenough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou spent your time pleasantly there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not. They were\\r\\nall very pleasant. I doubt their finding me so. I took uneasiness with\\r\\nme, and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Miss Owens--you liked them, did not you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very well. Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls. But I am\\r\\nspoilt, Fanny, for common female society. Good-humoured, unaffected\\r\\ngirls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They\\r\\nare two distinct orders of being. You and Miss Crawford have made me too\\r\\nnice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, however, Fanny was oppressed and wearied; he saw it in her looks,\\r\\nit could not be talked away; and attempting it no more, he led her\\r\\ndirectly, with the kind authority of a privileged guardian, into the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fanny\\r\\ncould tell, or could leave to be conjectured of her sentiments, and he\\r\\nwas satisfied. It had been, as he before presumed, too hasty a measure\\r\\non Crawford's side, and time must be given to make the idea first\\r\\nfamiliar, and then agreeable to her. She must be used to the\\r\\nconsideration of his being in love with her, and then a return of\\r\\naffection might not be very distant.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his father;\\r\\nand recommended there being nothing more said to her: no farther\\r\\nattempts to influence or persuade; but that everything should be left to\\r\\nCrawford's assiduities, and the natural workings of her own mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas promised that it should be so. Edmund's account of Fanny's\\r\\ndisposition he could believe to be just; he supposed she had all those\\r\\nfeelings, but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _had_;\\r\\nfor, less willing than his son to trust to the future, he could not\\r\\nhelp fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were\\r\\nnecessary for her, she might not have persuaded herself into receiving\\r\\nhis addresses properly before the young man's inclination for paying\\r\\nthem were over. There was nothing to be done, however, but to submit\\r\\nquietly and hope the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe promised visit from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cher friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Edmund called Miss Crawford,\\r\\nwas a formidable threat to Fanny, and she lived in continual terror of\\r\\nit. As a sister, so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous of\\r\\nwhat she said, and in another light so triumphant and secure, she was in\\r\\nevery way an object of painful alarm. Her displeasure, her penetration,\\r\\nand her happiness were all fearful to encounter; and the dependence of\\r\\nhaving others present when they met was Fanny's only support in looking\\r\\nforward to it. She absented herself as little as possible from Lady\\r\\nBertram, kept away from the East room, and took no solitary walk in the\\r\\nshrubbery, in her caution to avoid any sudden attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe succeeded. She was safe in the breakfast-room, with her aunt, when\\r\\nMiss Crawford did come; and the first misery over, and Miss Crawford\\r\\nlooking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than she\\r\\nhad anticipated, Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse to be\\r\\nendured than a half-hour of moderate agitation. But here she hoped too\\r\\nmuch; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity. She was determined\\r\\nto see Fanny alone, and therefore said to her tolerably soon, in a low\\r\\nvoice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; words that\\r\\nFanny felt all over her, in all her pulses and all her nerves. Denial\\r\\nwas impossible. Her habits of ready submission, on the contrary, made\\r\\nher almost instantly rise and lead the way out of the room. She did it\\r\\nwith wretched feelings, but it was inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance was\\r\\nover on Miss Crawford's side. She immediately shook her head at Fanny\\r\\nwith arch, yet affectionate reproach, and taking her hand, seemed hardly\\r\\nable to help beginning directly. She said nothing, however, but, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSad,\\r\\nsad girl! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and had\\r\\ndiscretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure of\\r\\nhaving four walls to themselves. Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and\\r\\ntook her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortable\\r\\nuse; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart, and feeling\\r\\nthat she had a more distressing scene before her than ever that spot had\\r\\nyet witnessed. But the evil ready to burst on her was at least delayed\\r\\nby the sudden change in Miss Crawford's ideas; by the strong effect on\\r\\nher mind which the finding herself in the East room again produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHa!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, with instant animation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cam I here again? The East\\r\\nroom! Once only was I in this room before\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and after stopping to look\\r\\nabout her, and seemingly to retrace all that had then passed, she added,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce only before. Do you remember it? I came to rehearse. Your cousin\\r\\ncame too; and we had a rehearsal. You were our audience and prompter.\\r\\nA delightful rehearsal. I shall never forget it. Here we were, just in\\r\\nthis part of the room: here was your cousin, here was I, here were the\\r\\nchairs. Oh! why will such things ever pass away?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHappily for her companion, she wanted no answer. Her mind was entirely\\r\\nself-engrossed. She was in a reverie of sweet remembrances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable! The subject of\\r\\nit so very--very--what shall I say? He was to be describing and\\r\\nrecommending matrimony to me. I think I see him now, trying to be as\\r\\ndemure and composed as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches.\\r\\n'When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony\\r\\nmay be called a happy life.' I suppose no time can ever wear out the\\r\\nimpression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words. It was\\r\\ncurious, very curious, that we should have such a scene to play! If I\\r\\nhad the power of recalling any one week of my existence, it should be\\r\\nthat week--that acting week. Say what you would, Fanny, it should be\\r\\n_that_; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. His\\r\\nsturdy spirit to bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression. But\\r\\nalas, that very evening destroyed it all. That very evening brought your\\r\\nmost unwelcome uncle. Poor Sir Thomas, who was glad to see you? Yet,\\r\\nFanny, do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas,\\r\\nthough I certainly did hate him for many a week. No, I do him justice\\r\\nnow. He is just what the head of such a family should be. Nay, in sober\\r\\nsadness, I believe I now love you all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And having said so, with a\\r\\ndegree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her\\r\\nbefore, and now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a moment\\r\\nto recover herself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have had a little fit since I came into this\\r\\nroom, as you may perceive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she presently, with a playful smile,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for as to\\r\\nscolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have not\\r\\nthe heart for it when it comes to the point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And embracing her very\\r\\naffectionately, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood, gentle Fanny! when I think of this being the\\r\\nlast time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite\\r\\nimpossible to do anything but love you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was affected. She had not foreseen anything of this, and her\\r\\nfeelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9clast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she\\r\\npossibly could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight of\\r\\nsuch emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hate to leave\\r\\nyou. I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going. Who says we\\r\\nshall not be sisters? I know we shall. I feel that we are born to\\r\\nbe connected; and those tears convince me that you feel it too, dear\\r\\nFanny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you are\\r\\nonly going from one set of friends to another. You are going to a very\\r\\nparticular friend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, very true. Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years. But\\r\\nI have not the least inclination to go near her. I can think only of the\\r\\nfriends I am leaving: my excellent sister, yourself, and the Bertrams in\\r\\ngeneral. You have all so much more _heart_ among you than one finds in\\r\\nthe world at large. You all give me a feeling of being able to trust and\\r\\nconfide in you, which in common intercourse one knows nothing of. I wish\\r\\nI had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter, a\\r\\nmuch better time for the visit, but now I cannot put her off. And when\\r\\nI have done with her I must go to her sister, Lady Stornaway, because\\r\\n_she_ was rather my most particular friend of the two, but I have not\\r\\ncared much for _her_ these three years.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent, each\\r\\nthoughtful: Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in the\\r\\nworld, Mary on something of less philosophic tendency. _She_ first spoke\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs, and\\r\\nsetting off to find my way to the East room, without having an idea\\r\\nwhereabouts it was! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came\\r\\nalong, and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at\\r\\nwork; and then your cousin's astonishment, when he opened the door, at\\r\\nseeing me here! To be sure, your uncle's returning that very evening!\\r\\nThere never was anything quite like it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother short fit of abstraction followed, when, shaking it off, she\\r\\nthus attacked her companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of one\\r\\nwho is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for a\\r\\nshort time into our circle in town, that you might understand how your\\r\\npower over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and heartburnings\\r\\nof dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that will be felt at\\r\\nhearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the hero\\r\\nof an old romance, and glories in his chains. You should come to London\\r\\nto know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to see how he is\\r\\ncourted, and how I am courted for his sake! Now, I am well aware that\\r\\nI shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his\\r\\nsituation with you. When she comes to know the truth she will, very\\r\\nlikely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is a daughter of\\r\\nMr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get married, and\\r\\nwants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to such a degree.\\r\\nInnocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an idea of the\\r\\n_sensation_ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity there will\\r\\nbe to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to answer! Poor\\r\\nMargaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth,\\r\\nand how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish Margaret were\\r\\nmarried, for my poor friend's sake, for I look upon the Frasers to be\\r\\nabout as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it was a most\\r\\ndesirable match for Janet at the time. We were all delighted. She could\\r\\nnot do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich, and she had nothing;\\r\\nbut he turns out ill-tempered and _exigeant_, and wants a young woman,\\r\\na beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be as steady as himself.\\r\\nAnd my friend does not manage him well; she does not seem to know how\\r\\nto make the best of it. There is a spirit of irritation which, to say\\r\\nnothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In their house I shall call\\r\\nto mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect. Even\\r\\nDr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister, and a certain\\r\\nconsideration for her judgment, which makes one feel there _is_\\r\\nattachment; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers. I shall\\r\\nbe at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as a wife, Sir Thomas\\r\\nBertram as a husband, are my standards of perfection. Poor Janet has\\r\\nbeen sadly taken in, and yet there was nothing improper on her side:\\r\\nshe did not run into the match inconsiderately; there was no want of\\r\\nforesight. She took three days to consider of his proposals, and during\\r\\nthose three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose\\r\\nopinion was worth having, and especially applied to my late dear aunt,\\r\\nwhose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and\\r\\ndeservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance, and\\r\\nshe was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were\\r\\na security for matrimonial comfort. I have not so much to say for my\\r\\nfriend Flora, who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake\\r\\nof that horrid Lord Stornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as\\r\\nMr. Rushworth, but much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character.\\r\\nI _had_ my doubts at the time about her being right, for he has not even\\r\\nthe air of a gentleman, and now I am sure she was wrong. By the bye,\\r\\nFlora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out. But were I\\r\\nto attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love\\r\\nwith him, I should never have done. It is you, only you, insensible\\r\\nFanny, who can think of him with anything like indifference. But are you\\r\\nso insensible as you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was, indeed, so deep a blush over Fanny's face at that moment as\\r\\nmight warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcellent creature! I will not tease you. Everything shall take its\\r\\ncourse. But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutely\\r\\nunprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies. It is not\\r\\npossible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject, some\\r\\nsurmises as to what might be. You must have seen that he was trying to\\r\\nplease you by every attention in his power. Was not he devoted to you\\r\\nat the ball? And then before the ball, the necklace! Oh! you received\\r\\nit just as it was meant. You were as conscious as heart could desire. I\\r\\nremember it perfectly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you mean, then, that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand?\\r\\nOh! Miss Crawford, _that_ was not fair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnew of it! It was his own doing entirely, his own thought. I am\\r\\nashamed to say that it had never entered my head, but I was delighted to\\r\\nact on his proposal for both your sakes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I was not half afraid at the time\\r\\nof its being so, for there was something in your look that frightened\\r\\nme, but not at first; I was as unsuspicious of it at first--indeed,\\r\\nindeed I was. It is as true as that I sit here. And had I had an idea\\r\\nof it, nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace. As to your\\r\\nbrother's behaviour, certainly I was sensible of a particularity: I had\\r\\nbeen sensible of it some little time, perhaps two or three weeks; but\\r\\nthen I considered it as meaning nothing: I put it down as simply being\\r\\nhis way, and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any\\r\\nserious thoughts of me. I had not, Miss Crawford, been an inattentive\\r\\nobserver of what was passing between him and some part of this family in\\r\\nthe summer and autumn. I was quiet, but I was not blind. I could not\\r\\nbut see that Mr. Crawford allowed himself in gallantries which did mean\\r\\nnothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh! I cannot deny it. He has now and then been a sad flirt, and\\r\\ncared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies'\\r\\naffections. I have often scolded him for it, but it is his only fault;\\r\\nand there is this to be said, that very few young ladies have any\\r\\naffections worth caring for. And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one\\r\\nwho has been shot at by so many; of having it in one's power to pay off\\r\\nthe debts of one's sex! Oh! I am sure it is not in woman's nature to\\r\\nrefuse such a triumph.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny shook her head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot think well of a man who sports with any\\r\\nwoman's feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than\\r\\na stander-by can judge of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not defend him. I leave him entirely to your mercy, and when he\\r\\nhas got you at Everingham, I do not care how much you lecture him. But\\r\\nthis I will say, that his fault, the liking to make girls a little\\r\\nin love with him, is not half so dangerous to a wife's happiness as a\\r\\ntendency to fall in love himself, which he has never been addicted to.\\r\\nAnd I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way\\r\\nthat he never was to any woman before; that he loves you with all his\\r\\nheart, and will love you as nearly for ever as possible. If any man ever\\r\\nloved a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as much for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued Mary\\r\\npresently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthan when he had succeeded in getting your brother's\\r\\ncommission.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had made a sure push at Fanny's feelings here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! yes. How very, very kind of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know he must have exerted himself very much, for I know the parties\\r\\nhe had to move. The Admiral hates trouble, and scorns asking favours;\\r\\nand there are so many young men's claims to be attended to in the same\\r\\nway, that a friendship and energy, not very determined, is easily put\\r\\nby. What a happy creature William must be! I wish we could see him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Fanny's mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its\\r\\nvarieties. The recollection of what had been done for William was always\\r\\nthe most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford; and\\r\\nshe sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been first watching\\r\\nher complacently, and then musing on something else, suddenly called\\r\\nher attention by saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should like to sit talking with you here all\\r\\nday, but we must not forget the ladies below, and so good-bye, my dear,\\r\\nmy amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall nominally part in\\r\\nthe breakfast-parlour, I must take leave of you here. And I do take\\r\\nleave, longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meet\\r\\nagain, it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each\\r\\nother without any remnant or shadow of reserve.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner, accompanied\\r\\nthese words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall see your cousin in town soon: he talks of being there tolerably\\r\\nsoon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say, in the course of the spring; and your\\r\\neldest cousin, and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am sure of meeting again\\r\\nand again, and all but you. I have two favours to ask, Fanny: one is\\r\\nyour correspondence. You must write to me. And the other, that you will\\r\\noften call on Mrs. Grant, and make her amends for my being gone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first, at least, of these favours Fanny would rather not have been\\r\\nasked; but it was impossible for her to refuse the correspondence; it\\r\\nwas impossible for her even not to accede to it more readily than\\r\\nher own judgment authorised. There was no resisting so much apparent\\r\\naffection. Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond\\r\\ntreatment, and from having hitherto known so little of it, she was the\\r\\nmore overcome by Miss Crawford's. Besides, there was gratitude towards\\r\\nher, for having made their _tete-a-tete_ so much less painful than her\\r\\nfears had predicted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was over, and she had escaped without reproaches and without\\r\\ndetection. Her secret was still her own; and while that was the case,\\r\\nshe thought she could resign herself to almost everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening there was another parting. Henry Crawford came and\\r\\nsat some time with them; and her spirits not being previously in the\\r\\nstrongest state, her heart was softened for a while towards him, because\\r\\nhe really seemed to feel. Quite unlike his usual self, he scarcely said\\r\\nanything. He was evidently oppressed, and Fanny must grieve for him,\\r\\nthough hoping she might never see him again till he were the husband of\\r\\nsome other woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it came to the moment of parting, he would take her hand, he would\\r\\nnot be denied it; he said nothing, however, or nothing that she heard,\\r\\nand when he had left the room, she was better pleased that such a token\\r\\nof friendship had passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morrow the Crawfords were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas's next object was that he should be\\r\\nmissed; and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blank\\r\\nin the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt, or\\r\\nfancied, an evil. She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering\\r\\nform; and he did hope that the loss of it, the sinking again into\\r\\nnothing, would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind. He watched her\\r\\nwith this idea; but he could hardly tell with what success. He hardly\\r\\nknew whether there were any difference in her spirits or not. She\\r\\nwas always so gentle and retiring that her emotions were beyond his\\r\\ndiscrimination. He did not understand her: he felt that he did not; and\\r\\ntherefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on the\\r\\npresent occasion, and whether she were more or less happy than she had\\r\\nbeen.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought his father\\r\\na little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could\\r\\nproduce any.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford's sister, the friend\\r\\nand companion who had been so much to her, should not be more visibly\\r\\nregretted. He wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _her_, and had so\\r\\nlittle voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! it was this sister, this friend and companion, who was now the\\r\\nchief bane of Fanny's comfort. If she could have believed Mary's future\\r\\nfate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother's\\r\\nshould be, if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant\\r\\nas she was much inclined to think his, she would have been light of\\r\\nheart indeed; but the more she recollected and observed, the more deeply\\r\\nwas she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss\\r\\nCrawford's marrying Edmund than it had ever been before. On his side the\\r\\ninclination was stronger, on hers less equivocal. His objections, the\\r\\nscruples of his integrity, seemed all done away, nobody could tell\\r\\nhow; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were equally got\\r\\nover--and equally without apparent reason. It could only be imputed to\\r\\nincreasing attachment. His good and her bad feelings yielded to love,\\r\\nand such love must unite them. He was to go to town as soon as some\\r\\nbusiness relative to Thornton Lacey were completed--perhaps within a\\r\\nfortnight; he talked of going, he loved to talk of it; and when once\\r\\nwith her again, Fanny could not doubt the rest. Her acceptance must be\\r\\nas certain as his offer; and yet there were bad feelings still remaining\\r\\nwhich made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her, independently, she\\r\\nbelieved, independently of self.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite of some amiable\\r\\nsensations, and much personal kindness, had still been Miss Crawford;\\r\\nstill shewn a mind led astray and bewildered, and without any suspicion\\r\\nof being so; darkened, yet fancying itself light. She might love, but\\r\\nshe did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment. Fanny believed there\\r\\nwas scarcely a second feeling in common between them; and she may be\\r\\nforgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford's\\r\\nfuture improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking that if Edmund's\\r\\ninfluence in this season of love had already done so little in clearing\\r\\nher judgment, and regulating her notions, his worth would be finally\\r\\nwasted on her even in years of matrimony.\\r\\n\\r\\nExperience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced,\\r\\nand impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford's nature that\\r\\nparticipation of the general nature of women which would lead her to\\r\\nadopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own. But\\r\\nas such were Fanny's persuasions, she suffered very much from them, and\\r\\ncould never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his own hopes and his own\\r\\nobservations, still feeling a right, by all his knowledge of human\\r\\nnature, to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence\\r\\non his niece's spirits, and the past attentions of the lover producing a\\r\\ncraving for their return; and he was soon afterwards able to account for\\r\\nhis not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this, by the prospect\\r\\nof another visitor, whose approach he could allow to be quite enough to\\r\\nsupport the spirits he was watching. William had obtained a ten days'\\r\\nleave of absence, to be given to Northamptonshire, and was coming, the\\r\\nhappiest of lieutenants, because the latest made, to shew his happiness\\r\\nand describe his uniform.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform there too,\\r\\nhad not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty. So the\\r\\nuniform remained at Portsmouth, and Edmund conjectured that before Fanny\\r\\nhad any chance of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the freshness\\r\\nof its wearer's feelings must be worn away. It would be sunk into a\\r\\nbadge of disgrace; for what can be more unbecoming, or more worthless,\\r\\nthan the uniform of a lieutenant, who has been a lieutenant a year or\\r\\ntwo, and sees others made commanders before him? So reasoned Edmund,\\r\\ntill his father made him the confidant of a scheme which placed Fanny's\\r\\nchance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all his glory\\r\\nin another light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis scheme was that she should accompany her brother back to\\r\\nPortsmouth, and spend a little time with her own family. It had occurred\\r\\nto Sir Thomas, in one of his dignified musings, as a right and desirable\\r\\nmeasure; but before he absolutely made up his mind, he consulted his\\r\\nson. Edmund considered it every way, and saw nothing but what was right.\\r\\nThe thing was good in itself, and could not be done at a better time;\\r\\nand he had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to Fanny. This was\\r\\nenough to determine Sir Thomas; and a decisive \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen so it shall be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n closed that stage of the business; Sir Thomas retiring from it with some\\r\\nfeelings of satisfaction, and views of good over and above what he had\\r\\ncommunicated to his son; for his prime motive in sending her away had\\r\\nvery little to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again,\\r\\nand nothing at all with any idea of making her happy. He certainly\\r\\nwished her to go willingly, but he as certainly wished her to be\\r\\nheartily sick of home before her visit ended; and that a little\\r\\nabstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park would\\r\\nbring her mind into a sober state, and incline her to a juster estimate\\r\\nof the value of that home of greater permanence, and equal comfort, of\\r\\nwhich she had the offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a medicinal project upon his niece's understanding, which he must\\r\\nconsider as at present diseased. A residence of eight or nine years in\\r\\nthe abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her powers of\\r\\ncomparing and judging. Her father's house would, in all probability,\\r\\nteach her the value of a good income; and he trusted that she would be\\r\\nthe wiser and happier woman, all her life, for the experiment he had\\r\\ndevised.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she must have had a strong\\r\\nattack of them when she first understood what was intended, when her\\r\\nuncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,\\r\\nand sisters, from whom she had been divided almost half her life; of\\r\\nreturning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy, with\\r\\nWilliam for the protector and companion of her journey, and the\\r\\ncertainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his remaining\\r\\non land. Had she ever given way to bursts of delight, it must have been\\r\\nthen, for she was delighted, but her happiness was of a quiet, deep,\\r\\nheart-swelling sort; and though never a great talker, she was always\\r\\nmore inclined to silence when feeling most strongly. At the moment she\\r\\ncould only thank and accept. Afterwards, when familiarised with the\\r\\nvisions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could speak more largely\\r\\nto William and Edmund of what she felt; but still there were emotions\\r\\nof tenderness that could not be clothed in words. The remembrance of all\\r\\nher earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered in being torn from\\r\\nthem, came over her with renewed strength, and it seemed as if to be\\r\\nat home again would heal every pain that had since grown out of the\\r\\nseparation. To be in the centre of such a circle, loved by so many,\\r\\nand more loved by all than she had ever been before; to feel affection\\r\\nwithout fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal of those who\\r\\nsurrounded her; to be at peace from all mention of the Crawfords, safe\\r\\nfrom every look which could be fancied a reproach on their account. This\\r\\nwas a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that could be but half\\r\\nacknowledged.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund, too--to be two months from _him_ (and perhaps she might be\\r\\nallowed to make her absence three) must do her good. At a distance,\\r\\nunassailed by his looks or his kindness, and safe from the perpetual\\r\\nirritation of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his confidence,\\r\\nshe should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she should\\r\\nbe able to think of him as in London, and arranging everything there,\\r\\nwithout wretchedness. What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield was\\r\\nto become a slight evil at Portsmouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only drawback was the doubt of her aunt Bertram's being comfortable\\r\\nwithout her. She was of use to no one else; but _there_ she might be\\r\\nmissed to a degree that she did not like to think of; and that part of\\r\\nthe arrangement was, indeed, the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish,\\r\\nand what only _he_ could have accomplished at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was master at Mansfield Park. When he had really resolved on\\r\\nany measure, he could always carry it through; and now by dint of long\\r\\ntalking on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny's\\r\\nsometimes seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go;\\r\\nobtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction, for Lady\\r\\nBertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought\\r\\nFanny ought to go, and therefore that she must. In the calmness of\\r\\nher own dressing-room, in the impartial flow of her own meditations,\\r\\nunbiassed by his bewildering statements, she could not acknowledge any\\r\\nnecessity for Fanny's ever going near a father and mother who had done\\r\\nwithout her so long, while she was so useful to herself. And as to the\\r\\nnot missing her, which under Mrs. Norris's discussion was the point\\r\\nattempted to be proved, she set herself very steadily against admitting\\r\\nany such thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas had appealed to her reason, conscience, and dignity. He\\r\\ncalled it a sacrifice, and demanded it of her goodness and self-command\\r\\nas such. But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be very\\r\\nwell spared--_she_ being ready to give up all her own time to her as\\r\\nrequested--and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat may be, sister,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was all Lady Bertram's reply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI dare say you are\\r\\nvery right; but I am sure I shall miss her very much.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next step was to communicate with Portsmouth. Fanny wrote to offer\\r\\nherself; and her mother's answer, though short, was so kind--a few\\r\\nsimple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect\\r\\nof seeing her child again, as to confirm all the daughter's views of\\r\\nhappiness in being with her--convincing her that she should now find a\\r\\nwarm and affectionate friend in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmama\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who had certainly shewn no\\r\\nremarkable fondness for her formerly; but this she could easily suppose\\r\\nto have been her own fault or her own fancy. She had probably alienated\\r\\nlove by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper, or been\\r\\nunreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many could\\r\\ndeserve. Now, when she knew better how to be useful, and how to forbear,\\r\\nand when her mother could be no longer occupied by the incessant\\r\\ndemands of a house full of little children, there would be leisure and\\r\\ninclination for every comfort, and they should soon be what mother and\\r\\ndaughter ought to be to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam was almost as happy in the plan as his sister. It would be the\\r\\ngreatest pleasure to him to have her there to the last moment before he\\r\\nsailed, and perhaps find her there still when he came in from his first\\r\\ncruise. And besides, he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush before\\r\\nshe went out of harbour--the Thrush was certainly the finest sloop in\\r\\nthe service--and there were several improvements in the dockyard, too,\\r\\nwhich he quite longed to shew her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not scruple to add that her being at home for a while would be a\\r\\ngreat advantage to everybody.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know how it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut we seem to want some of\\r\\nyour nice ways and orderliness at my father's. The house is always in\\r\\nconfusion. You will set things going in a better way, I am sure. You\\r\\nwill tell my mother how it all ought to be, and you will be so useful to\\r\\nSusan, and you will teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind you.\\r\\nHow right and comfortable it will all be!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time Mrs. Price's answer arrived, there remained but a very few\\r\\ndays more to be spent at Mansfield; and for part of one of those days\\r\\nthe young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of\\r\\ntheir journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of, and Mrs.\\r\\nNorris found that all her anxiety to save her brother-in-law's money\\r\\nwas vain, and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive\\r\\nconveyance of Fanny, they were to travel post; when she saw Sir Thomas\\r\\nactually give William notes for the purpose, she was struck with the\\r\\nidea of there being room for a third in the carriage, and suddenly\\r\\nseized with a strong inclination to go with them, to go and see her poor\\r\\ndear sister Price. She proclaimed her thoughts. She must say that she\\r\\nhad more than half a mind to go with the young people; it would be such\\r\\nan indulgence to her; she had not seen her poor dear sister Price for\\r\\nmore than twenty years; and it would be a help to the young people in\\r\\ntheir journey to have her older head to manage for them; and she could\\r\\nnot help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkind\\r\\nof her not to come by such an opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam and Fanny were horror-struck at the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the comfort of their comfortable journey would be destroyed at\\r\\nonce. With woeful countenances they looked at each other. Their suspense\\r\\nlasted an hour or two. No one interfered to encourage or dissuade. Mrs.\\r\\nNorris was left to settle the matter by herself; and it ended, to the\\r\\ninfinite joy of her nephew and niece, in the recollection that she could\\r\\nnot possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present; that she was a\\r\\ngreat deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to\\r\\nbe able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week, and\\r\\ntherefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being\\r\\nuseful to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had, in fact, occurred to her, that though taken to Portsmouth for\\r\\nnothing, it would be hardly possible for her to avoid paying her own\\r\\nexpenses back again. So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the\\r\\ndisappointment of her missing such an opportunity, and another twenty\\r\\nyears' absence, perhaps, begun.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund's plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey, this absence of\\r\\nFanny's. He too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as his\\r\\naunt. He had intended, about this time, to be going to London; but he\\r\\ncould not leave his father and mother just when everybody else of most\\r\\nimportance to their comfort was leaving them; and with an effort, felt\\r\\nbut not boasted of, he delayed for a week or two longer a journey which\\r\\nhe was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness for\\r\\never.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told Fanny of it. She knew so much already, that she must know\\r\\neverything. It made the substance of one other confidential discourse\\r\\nabout Miss Crawford; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to\\r\\nbe the last time in which Miss Crawford's name would ever be mentioned\\r\\nbetween them with any remains of liberty. Once afterwards she was\\r\\nalluded to by him. Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in the\\r\\nevening to write to her soon and often, and promising to be a good\\r\\ncorrespondent herself; and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then added\\r\\nin a whisper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd _I_ shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything\\r\\nworth writing about, anything to say that I think you will like to hear,\\r\\nand that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Had she\\r\\ndoubted his meaning while she listened, the glow in his face, when she\\r\\nlooked up at him, would have been decisive.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this letter she must try to arm herself. That a letter from Edmund\\r\\nshould be a subject of terror! She began to feel that she had not yet\\r\\ngone through all the changes of opinion and sentiment which the progress\\r\\nof time and variation of circumstances occasion in this world of\\r\\nchanges. The vicissitudes of the human mind had not yet been exhausted\\r\\nby her.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Fanny! though going as she did willingly and eagerly, the last\\r\\nevening at Mansfield Park must still be wretchedness. Her heart was\\r\\ncompletely sad at parting. She had tears for every room in the house,\\r\\nmuch more for every beloved inhabitant. She clung to her aunt, because\\r\\nshe would miss her; she kissed the hand of her uncle with struggling\\r\\nsobs, because she had displeased him; and as for Edmund, she could\\r\\nneither speak, nor look, nor think, when the last moment came with\\r\\n_him_; and it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her\\r\\nthe affectionate farewell of a brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this passed overnight, for the journey was to begin very early in\\r\\nthe morning; and when the small, diminished party met at breakfast,\\r\\nWilliam and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being with William, soon\\r\\nproduced their natural effect on Fanny's spirits, when Mansfield Park\\r\\nwas fairly left behind; and by the time their first stage was ended, and\\r\\nthey were to quit Sir Thomas's carriage, she was able to take leave of\\r\\nthe old coachman, and send back proper messages, with cheerful looks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end.\\r\\nEverything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William's mind, and\\r\\nhe was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher-toned\\r\\nsubjects, all of which ended, if they did not begin, in praise of the\\r\\nThrush, conjectures how she would be employed, schemes for an action\\r\\nwith some superior force, which (supposing the first lieutenant out of\\r\\nthe way, and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant) was\\r\\nto give himself the next step as soon as possible, or speculations upon\\r\\nprize-money, which was to be generously distributed at home, with only\\r\\nthe reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable,\\r\\nin which he and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's immediate concerns, as far as they involved Mr. Crawford, made\\r\\nno part of their conversation. William knew what had passed, and from\\r\\nhis heart lamented that his sister's feelings should be so cold towards\\r\\na man whom he must consider as the first of human characters; but he was\\r\\nof an age to be all for love, and therefore unable to blame; and knowing\\r\\nher wish on the subject, he would not distress her by the slightest\\r\\nallusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford. She\\r\\nhad heard repeatedly from his sister within the three weeks which had\\r\\npassed since their leaving Mansfield, and in each letter there had been\\r\\na few lines from himself, warm and determined like his speeches. It\\r\\nwas a correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she had\\r\\nfeared. Miss Crawford's style of writing, lively and affectionate, was\\r\\nitself an evil, independent of what she was thus forced into reading\\r\\nfrom the brother's pen, for Edmund would never rest till she had read\\r\\nthe chief of the letter to him; and then she had to listen to his\\r\\nadmiration of her language, and the warmth of her attachments. There\\r\\nhad, in fact, been so much of message, of allusion, of recollection, so\\r\\nmuch of Mansfield in every letter, that Fanny could not but suppose it\\r\\nmeant for him to hear; and to find herself forced into a purpose of\\r\\nthat kind, compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her the\\r\\naddresses of the man she did not love, and obliging her to administer\\r\\nto the adverse passion of the man she did, was cruelly mortifying. Here,\\r\\ntoo, her present removal promised advantage. When no longer under the\\r\\nsame roof with Edmund, she trusted that Miss Crawford would have no\\r\\nmotive for writing strong enough to overcome the trouble, and that at\\r\\nPortsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such thoughts as these, among ten hundred others, Fanny proceeded\\r\\nin her journey safely and cheerfully, and as expeditiously as could\\r\\nrationally be hoped in the dirty month of February. They entered Oxford,\\r\\nbut she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund's college as they\\r\\npassed along, and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury, where\\r\\na comfortable meal, uniting dinner and supper, wound up the enjoyments\\r\\nand fatigues of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning saw them off again at an early hour; and with no\\r\\nevents, and no delays, they regularly advanced, and were in the environs\\r\\nof Portsmouth while there was yet daylight for Fanny to look around her,\\r\\nand wonder at the new buildings. They passed the drawbridge, and\\r\\nentered the town; and the light was only beginning to fail as, guided\\r\\nby William's powerful voice, they were rattled into a narrow street,\\r\\nleading from the High Street, and drawn up before the door of a small\\r\\nhouse now inhabited by Mr. Price.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was all agitation and flutter; all hope and apprehension. The\\r\\nmoment they stopped, a trollopy-looking maidservant, seemingly in\\r\\nwaiting for them at the door, stepped forward, and more intent on\\r\\ntelling the news than giving them any help, immediately began with, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nThrush is gone out of harbour, please sir, and one of the officers has\\r\\nbeen here to--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven years\\r\\nold, who, rushing out of the house, pushed the maid aside, and while\\r\\nWilliam was opening the chaise-door himself, called out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are just\\r\\nin time. We have been looking for you this half-hour. The Thrush went\\r\\nout of harbour this morning. I saw her. It was a beautiful sight. And\\r\\nthey think she will have her orders in a day or two. And Mr. Campbell\\r\\nwas here at four o'clock to ask for you: he has got one of the Thrush's\\r\\nboats, and is going off to her at six, and hoped you would be here in\\r\\ntime to go with him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of the carriage, was\\r\\nall the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he made no\\r\\nobjection to her kissing him, though still entirely engaged in detailing\\r\\nfarther particulars of the Thrush's going out of harbour, in which\\r\\nhe had a strong right of interest, being to commence his career of\\r\\nseamanship in her at this very time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage of the\\r\\nhouse, and in her mother's arms, who met her there with looks of true\\r\\nkindness, and with features which Fanny loved the more, because they\\r\\nbrought her aunt Bertram's before her, and there were her two sisters:\\r\\nSusan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey, the youngest of\\r\\nthe family, about five--both glad to see her in their way, though with\\r\\nno advantage of manner in receiving her. But manner Fanny did not want.\\r\\nWould they but love her, she should be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was then taken into a parlour, so small that her first conviction\\r\\nwas of its being only a passage-room to something better, and she stood\\r\\nfor a moment expecting to be invited on; but when she saw there was\\r\\nno other door, and that there were signs of habitation before her, she\\r\\ncalled back her thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved lest they should\\r\\nhave been suspected. Her mother, however, could not stay long enough\\r\\nto suspect anything. She was gone again to the street-door, to welcome\\r\\nWilliam. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you. But have you\\r\\nheard about the Thrush? She is gone out of harbour already; three days\\r\\nbefore we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do about\\r\\nSam's things, they will never be ready in time; for she may have her\\r\\norders to-morrow, perhaps. It takes me quite unawares. And now you must\\r\\nbe off for Spithead too. Campbell has been here, quite in a worry about\\r\\nyou; and now what shall we do? I thought to have had such a comfortable\\r\\nevening with you, and here everything comes upon me at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer son answered cheerfully, telling her that everything was always for\\r\\nthe best; and making light of his own inconvenience in being obliged to\\r\\nhurry away so soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, I had much rather she had stayed in harbour, that I might\\r\\nhave sat a few hours with you in comfort; but as there is a boat ashore,\\r\\nI had better go off at once, and there is no help for it. Whereabouts\\r\\ndoes the Thrush lay at Spithead? Near the Canopus? But no matter; here's\\r\\nFanny in the parlour, and why should we stay in the passage? Come,\\r\\nmother, you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her daughter\\r\\nagain, and commented a little on her growth, began with very natural\\r\\nsolicitude to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor dears! how tired you must both be! and now, what will you have? I\\r\\nbegan to think you would never come. Betsey and I have been watching for\\r\\nyou this half-hour. And when did you get anything to eat? And what would\\r\\nyou like to have now? I could not tell whether you would be for some\\r\\nmeat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey, or else I would have\\r\\ngot something ready. And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before\\r\\nthere is time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand. It is\\r\\nvery inconvenient to have no butcher in the street. We were better off\\r\\nin our last house. Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be\\r\\ngot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both declared they should prefer it to anything. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen, Betsey, my\\r\\ndear, run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on; and\\r\\ntell her to bring in the tea-things as soon as she can. I wish we could\\r\\nget the bell mended; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBetsey went with alacrity, proud to shew her abilities before her fine\\r\\nnew sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued the anxious mother, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat a sad fire we have got,\\r\\nand I dare say you are both starved with cold. Draw your chair nearer,\\r\\nmy dear. I cannot think what Rebecca has been about. I am sure I told\\r\\nher to bring some coals half an hour ago. Susan, you should have taken\\r\\ncare of the fire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was upstairs, mama, moving my things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Susan, in a fearless,\\r\\nself-defending tone, which startled Fanny. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know you had but just\\r\\nsettled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room; and I\\r\\ncould not get Rebecca to give me any help.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFarther discussion was prevented by various bustles: first, the driver\\r\\ncame to be paid; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca about\\r\\nthe manner of carrying up his sister's trunk, which he would manage all\\r\\nhis own way; and lastly, in walked Mr. Price himself, his own loud voice\\r\\npreceding him, as with something of the oath kind he kicked away his\\r\\nson's port-manteau and his daughter's bandbox in the passage, and called\\r\\nout for a candle; no candle was brought, however, and he walked into the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him, but sank down again\\r\\non finding herself undistinguished in the dusk, and unthought of. With\\r\\na friendly shake of his son's hand, and an eager voice, he instantly\\r\\nbegan--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHa! welcome back, my boy. Glad to see you. Have you heard the\\r\\nnews? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning. Sharp is the\\r\\nword, you see! By G--, you are just in time! The doctor has been here\\r\\ninquiring for you: he has got one of the boats, and is to be off for\\r\\nSpithead by six, so you had better go with him. I have been to Turner's\\r\\nabout your mess; it is all in a way to be done. I should not wonder if\\r\\nyou had your orders to-morrow: but you cannot sail with this wind, if\\r\\nyou are to cruise to the westward; and Captain Walsh thinks you will\\r\\ncertainly have a cruise to the westward, with the Elephant. By G--, I\\r\\nwish you may! But old Scholey was saying, just now, that he thought you\\r\\nwould be sent first to the Texel. Well, well, we are ready, whatever\\r\\nhappens. But by G--, you lost a fine sight by not being here in the\\r\\nmorning to see the Thrush go out of harbour! I would not have been out\\r\\nof the way for a thousand pounds. Old Scholey ran in at breakfast-time,\\r\\nto say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out, I jumped up, and\\r\\nmade but two steps to the platform. If ever there was a perfect beauty\\r\\nafloat, she is one; and there she lays at Spithead, and anybody in\\r\\nEngland would take her for an eight-and-twenty. I was upon the platform\\r\\ntwo hours this afternoon looking at her. She lays close to the Endymion,\\r\\nbetween her and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward of the sheer hulk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHa!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried William, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_that's_ just where I should have put her myself.\\r\\nIt's the best berth at Spithead. But here is my sister, sir; here is\\r\\nFanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d turning and leading her forward; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is so dark you do not see\\r\\nher.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her, Mr. Price now\\r\\nreceived his daughter; and having given her a cordial hug, and observed\\r\\nthat she was grown into a woman, and he supposed would be wanting a\\r\\nhusband soon, seemed very much inclined to forget her again. Fanny\\r\\nshrunk back to her seat, with feelings sadly pained by his language and\\r\\nhis smell of spirits; and he talked on only to his son, and only of the\\r\\nThrush, though William, warmly interested as he was in that subject,\\r\\nmore than once tried to make his father think of Fanny, and her long\\r\\nabsence and long journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained; but as there was\\r\\nstill no appearance of tea, nor, from Betsey's reports from the kitchen,\\r\\nmuch hope of any under a considerable period, William determined to\\r\\ngo and change his dress, and make the necessary preparations for\\r\\nhis removal on board directly, that he might have his tea in comfort\\r\\nafterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he left the room, two rosy-faced boys, ragged and dirty, about eight\\r\\nand nine years old, rushed into it just released from school, and coming\\r\\neagerly to see their sister, and tell that the Thrush was gone out of\\r\\nharbour; Tom and Charles. Charles had been born since Fanny's going\\r\\naway, but Tom she had often helped to nurse, and now felt a particular\\r\\npleasure in seeing again. Both were kissed very tenderly, but Tom she\\r\\nwanted to keep by her, to try to trace the features of the baby she had\\r\\nloved, and talked to, of his infant preference of herself. Tom, however,\\r\\nhad no mind for such treatment: he came home not to stand and be talked\\r\\nto, but to run about and make a noise; and both boys had soon burst from\\r\\nher, and slammed the parlour-door till her temples ached.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had now seen all that were at home; there remained only two brothers\\r\\nbetween herself and Susan, one of whom was a clerk in a public office\\r\\nin London, and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman. But though she\\r\\nhad _seen_ all the members of the family, she had not yet _heard_ all\\r\\nthe noise they could make. Another quarter of an hour brought her a\\r\\ngreat deal more. William was soon calling out from the landing-place of\\r\\nthe second story for his mother and for Rebecca. He was in distress\\r\\nfor something that he had left there, and did not find again. A key was\\r\\nmislaid, Betsey accused of having got at his new hat, and some slight,\\r\\nbut essential alteration of his uniform waistcoat, which he had been\\r\\npromised to have done for him, entirely neglected.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Price, Rebecca, and Betsey all went up to defend themselves, all\\r\\ntalking together, but Rebecca loudest, and the job was to be done as\\r\\nwell as it could in a great hurry; William trying in vain to send Betsey\\r\\ndown again, or keep her from being troublesome where she was; the whole\\r\\nof which, as almost every door in the house was open, could be plainly\\r\\ndistinguished in the parlour, except when drowned at intervals by the\\r\\nsuperior noise of Sam, Tom, and Charles chasing each other up and down\\r\\nstairs, and tumbling about and hallooing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was almost stunned. The smallness of the house and thinness of the\\r\\nwalls brought everything so close to her, that, added to the fatigue of\\r\\nher journey, and all her recent agitation, she hardly knew how to\\r\\nbear it. _Within_ the room all was tranquil enough, for Susan having\\r\\ndisappeared with the others, there were soon only her father and herself\\r\\nremaining; and he, taking out a newspaper, the accustomary loan of a\\r\\nneighbour, applied himself to studying it, without seeming to recollect\\r\\nher existence. The solitary candle was held between himself and the\\r\\npaper, without any reference to her possible convenience; but she had\\r\\nnothing to do, and was glad to have the light screened from her aching\\r\\nhead, as she sat in bewildered, broken, sorrowful contemplation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was at home. But, alas! it was not such a home, she had not such a\\r\\nwelcome, as--she checked herself; she was unreasonable. What right had\\r\\nshe to be of importance to her family? She could have none, so long lost\\r\\nsight of! William's concerns must be dearest, they always had been, and\\r\\nhe had every right. Yet to have so little said or asked about herself,\\r\\nto have scarcely an inquiry made after Mansfield! It did pain her to\\r\\nhave Mansfield forgotten; the friends who had done so much--the dear,\\r\\ndear friends! But here, one subject swallowed up all the rest. Perhaps\\r\\nit must be so. The destination of the Thrush must be now preeminently\\r\\ninteresting. A day or two might shew the difference. _She_ only was to\\r\\nblame. Yet she thought it would not have been so at Mansfield. No, in\\r\\nher uncle's house there would have been a consideration of times and\\r\\nseasons, a regulation of subject, a propriety, an attention towards\\r\\neverybody which there was not here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly half\\r\\nan hour was from a sudden burst of her father's, not at all calculated\\r\\nto compose them. At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooing\\r\\nin the passage, he exclaimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDevil take those young dogs! How they are\\r\\nsinging out! Ay, Sam's voice louder than all the rest! That boy is fit\\r\\nfor a boatswain. Holla, you there! Sam, stop your confounded pipe, or I\\r\\nshall be after you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis threat was so palpably disregarded, that though within five minutes\\r\\nafterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and sat down,\\r\\nFanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than their\\r\\nbeing for the time thoroughly fagged, which their hot faces and panting\\r\\nbreaths seemed to prove, especially as they were still kicking each\\r\\nother's shins, and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately under\\r\\ntheir father's eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next opening of the door brought something more welcome: it was for\\r\\nthe tea-things, which she had begun almost to despair of seeing that\\r\\nevening. Susan and an attendant girl, whose inferior appearance informed\\r\\nFanny, to her great surprise, that she had previously seen the upper\\r\\nservant, brought in everything necessary for the meal; Susan looking, as\\r\\nshe put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister, as if divided\\r\\nbetween the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and usefulness,\\r\\nand the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an office. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\r\\nhad been into the kitchen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto hurry Sally and help make the\\r\\ntoast, and spread the bread and butter, or she did not know when they\\r\\nshould have got tea, and she was sure her sister must want something\\r\\nafter her journey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was very thankful. She could not but own that she should be very\\r\\nglad of a little tea, and Susan immediately set about making it, as if\\r\\npleased to have the employment all to herself; and with only a little\\r\\nunnecessary bustle, and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her\\r\\nbrothers in better order than she could, acquitted herself very well.\\r\\nFanny's spirit was as much refreshed as her body; her head and heart\\r\\nwere soon the better for such well-timed kindness. Susan had an open,\\r\\nsensible countenance; she was like William, and Fanny hoped to find her\\r\\nlike him in disposition and goodwill towards herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this more placid state of things William reentered, followed not\\r\\nfar behind by his mother and Betsey. He, complete in his lieutenant's\\r\\nuniform, looking and moving all the taller, firmer, and more graceful\\r\\nfor it, and with the happiest smile over his face, walked up directly\\r\\nto Fanny, who, rising from her seat, looked at him for a moment in\\r\\nspeechless admiration, and then threw her arms round his neck to sob out\\r\\nher various emotions of pain and pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnxious not to appear unhappy, she soon recovered herself; and wiping\\r\\naway her tears, was able to notice and admire all the striking parts\\r\\nof his dress; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of\\r\\nbeing on shore some part of every day before they sailed, and even of\\r\\ngetting her to Spithead to see the sloop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell, the surgeon of the Thrush, a\\r\\nvery well-behaved young man, who came to call for his friend, and for\\r\\nwhom there was with some contrivance found a chair, and with some hasty\\r\\nwashing of the young tea-maker's, a cup and saucer; and after another\\r\\nquarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen, noise rising\\r\\nupon noise, and bustle upon bustle, men and boys at last all in motion\\r\\ntogether, the moment came for setting off; everything was ready, William\\r\\ntook leave, and all of them were gone; for the three boys, in spite\\r\\nof their mother's entreaty, determined to see their brother and Mr.\\r\\nCampbell to the sally-port; and Mr. Price walked off at the same time to\\r\\ncarry back his neighbour's newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething like tranquillity might now be hoped for; and accordingly,\\r\\nwhen Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea-things,\\r\\nand Mrs. Price had walked about the room some time looking for a\\r\\nshirt-sleeve, which Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the\\r\\nkitchen, the small party of females were pretty well composed, and the\\r\\nmother having lamented again over the impossibility of getting Sam ready\\r\\nin time, was at leisure to think of her eldest daughter and the friends\\r\\nshe had come from.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few inquiries began: but one of the earliest--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow did sister Bertram\\r\\nmanage about her servants?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWas she as much plagued as herself to get\\r\\ntolerable servants?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--soon led her mind away from Northamptonshire, and\\r\\nfixed it on her own domestic grievances, and the shocking character of\\r\\nall the Portsmouth servants, of whom she believed her own two were the\\r\\nvery worst, engrossed her completely. The Bertrams were all forgotten\\r\\nin detailing the faults of Rebecca, against whom Susan had also much\\r\\nto depose, and little Betsey a great deal more, and who did seem so\\r\\nthoroughly without a single recommendation, that Fanny could not help\\r\\nmodestly presuming that her mother meant to part with her when her year\\r\\nwas up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer year!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Price; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure I hope I shall be rid of her\\r\\nbefore she has staid a year, for that will not be up till November.\\r\\nServants are come to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it is\\r\\nquite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year. I have no hope\\r\\nof ever being settled; and if I was to part with Rebecca, I should\\r\\nonly get something worse. And yet I do not think I am a very difficult\\r\\nmistress to please; and I am sure the place is easy enough, for there is\\r\\nalways a girl under her, and I often do half the work myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was silent; but not from being convinced that there might not be a\\r\\nremedy found for some of these evils. As she now sat looking at Betsey,\\r\\nshe could not but think particularly of another sister, a very pretty\\r\\nlittle girl, whom she had left there not much younger when she went into\\r\\nNorthamptonshire, who had died a few years afterwards. There had been\\r\\nsomething remarkably amiable about her. Fanny in those early days had\\r\\npreferred her to Susan; and when the news of her death had at last\\r\\nreached Mansfield, had for a short time been quite afflicted. The sight\\r\\nof Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again, but she would\\r\\nnot have pained her mother by alluding to her for the world. While\\r\\nconsidering her with these ideas, Betsey, at a small distance, was\\r\\nholding out something to catch her eyes, meaning to screen it at the\\r\\nsame time from Susan's.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat have you got there, my love?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny; \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccome and shew it to\\r\\nme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a silver knife. Up jumped Susan, claiming it as her own, and\\r\\ntrying to get it away; but the child ran to her mother's protection,\\r\\nand Susan could only reproach, which she did very warmly, and evidently\\r\\nhoping to interest Fanny on her side. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was very hard that she was not\\r\\nto have her _own_ knife; it was her own knife; little sister Mary had\\r\\nleft it to her upon her deathbed, and she ought to have had it to keep\\r\\nherself long ago. But mama kept it from her, and was always letting\\r\\nBetsey get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey would\\r\\nspoil it, and get it for her own, though mama had _promised_ her that\\r\\nBetsey should not have it in her own hands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was quite shocked. Every feeling of duty, honour, and tenderness\\r\\nwas wounded by her sister's speech and her mother's reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Susan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Price, in a complaining voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnow, how can\\r\\nyou be so cross? You are always quarrelling about that knife. I wish you\\r\\nwould not be so quarrelsome. Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is to\\r\\nyou! But you should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you to\\r\\nthe drawer. You know I told you not to touch it, because Susan is so\\r\\ncross about it. I must hide it another time, Betsey. Poor Mary little\\r\\nthought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to\\r\\nkeep, only two hours before she died. Poor little soul! she could but\\r\\njust speak to be heard, and she said so prettily, 'Let sister Susan have\\r\\nmy knife, mama, when I am dead and buried.' Poor little dear! she was so\\r\\nfond of it, Fanny, that she would have it lay by her in bed, all through\\r\\nher illness. It was the gift of her good godmother, old Mrs. Admiral\\r\\nMaxwell, only six weeks before she was taken for death. Poor little\\r\\nsweet creature! Well, she was taken away from evil to come. My own\\r\\nBetsey\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (fondling her), \\xe2\\x80\\x9c_you_ have not the luck of such a good\\r\\ngodmother. Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people\\r\\nas you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris, but a message to\\r\\nsay she hoped that her god-daughter was a good girl, and learnt her\\r\\nbook. There had been at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing-room\\r\\nat Mansfield Park about sending her a prayer-book; but no second sound\\r\\nhad been heard of such a purpose. Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home\\r\\nand taken down two old prayer-books of her husband with that idea; but,\\r\\nupon examination, the ardour of generosity went off. One was found\\r\\nto have too small a print for a child's eyes, and the other to be too\\r\\ncumbersome for her to carry about.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny, fatigued and fatigued again, was thankful to accept the first\\r\\ninvitation of going to bed; and before Betsey had finished her cry at\\r\\nbeing allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of sister,\\r\\nshe was off, leaving all below in confusion and noise again; the boys\\r\\nbegging for toasted cheese, her father calling out for his rum and\\r\\nwater, and Rebecca never where she ought to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined and scantily\\r\\nfurnished chamber that she was to share with Susan. The smallness of\\r\\nthe rooms above and below, indeed, and the narrowness of the passage and\\r\\nstaircase, struck her beyond her imagination. She soon learned to think\\r\\nwith respect of her own little attic at Mansfield Park, in _that_ house\\r\\nreckoned too small for anybody's comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\nCould Sir Thomas have seen all his niece's feelings, when she wrote her\\r\\nfirst letter to her aunt, he would not have despaired; for though a good\\r\\nnight's rest, a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William again,\\r\\nand the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom and Charles\\r\\nbeing gone to school, Sam on some project of his own, and her father\\r\\non his usual lounges, enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the\\r\\nsubject of home, there were still, to her own perfect consciousness,\\r\\nmany drawbacks suppressed. Could he have seen only half that she felt\\r\\nbefore the end of a week, he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of\\r\\nher, and been delighted with his own sagacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the week ended, it was all disappointment. In the first place,\\r\\nWilliam was gone. The Thrush had had her orders, the wind had changed,\\r\\nand he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth; and\\r\\nduring those days she had seen him only twice, in a short and\\r\\nhurried way, when he had come ashore on duty. There had been no free\\r\\nconversation, no walk on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, no\\r\\nacquaintance with the Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned and\\r\\ndepended on. Everything in that quarter failed her, except William's\\r\\naffection. His last thought on leaving home was for her. He stepped back\\r\\nagain to the door to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake care of Fanny, mother. She is tender,\\r\\nand not used to rough it like the rest of us. I charge you, take care of\\r\\nFanny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam was gone: and the home he had left her in was, Fanny could not\\r\\nconceal it from herself, in almost every respect the very reverse of\\r\\nwhat she could have wished. It was the abode of noise, disorder, and\\r\\nimpropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it\\r\\nought to be. She could not respect her parents as she had hoped. On her\\r\\nfather, her confidence had not been sanguine, but he was more negligent\\r\\nof his family, his habits were worse, and his manners coarser, than\\r\\nshe had been prepared for. He did not want abilities but he had no\\r\\ncuriosity, and no information beyond his profession; he read only\\r\\nthe newspaper and the navy-list; he talked only of the dockyard, the\\r\\nharbour, Spithead, and the Motherbank; he swore and he drank, he was\\r\\ndirty and gross. She had never been able to recall anything approaching\\r\\nto tenderness in his former treatment of herself. There had remained\\r\\nonly a general impression of roughness and loudness; and now he scarcely\\r\\never noticed her, but to make her the object of a coarse joke.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer disappointment in her mother was greater: _there_ she had hoped\\r\\nmuch, and found almost nothing. Every flattering scheme of being of\\r\\nconsequence to her soon fell to the ground. Mrs. Price was not unkind;\\r\\nbut, instead of gaining on her affection and confidence, and becoming\\r\\nmore and more dear, her daughter never met with greater kindness from\\r\\nher than on the first day of her arrival. The instinct of nature was\\r\\nsoon satisfied, and Mrs. Price's attachment had no other source. Her\\r\\nheart and her time were already quite full; she had neither leisure nor\\r\\naffection to bestow on Fanny. Her daughters never had been much to her.\\r\\nShe was fond of her sons, especially of William, but Betsey was the\\r\\nfirst of her girls whom she had ever much regarded. To her she was most\\r\\ninjudiciously indulgent. William was her pride; Betsey her darling;\\r\\nand John, Richard, Sam, Tom, and Charles occupied all the rest of her\\r\\nmaternal solicitude, alternately her worries and her comforts. These\\r\\nshared her heart: her time was given chiefly to her house and her\\r\\nservants. Her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle; all was busy\\r\\nwithout getting on, always behindhand and lamenting it, without altering\\r\\nher ways; wishing to be an economist, without contrivance or regularity;\\r\\ndissatisfied with her servants, without skill to make them better, and\\r\\nwhether helping, or reprimanding, or indulging them, without any power\\r\\nof engaging their respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram\\r\\nthan Mrs. Norris. She was a manager by necessity, without any of Mrs.\\r\\nNorris's inclination for it, or any of her activity. Her disposition\\r\\nwas naturally easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram's; and a situation of\\r\\nsimilar affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more suited\\r\\nto her capacity than the exertions and self-denials of the one which her\\r\\nimprudent marriage had placed her in. She might have made just as good a\\r\\nwoman of consequence as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris would have been a\\r\\nmore respectable mother of nine children on a small income.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of. She might scruple\\r\\nto make use of the words, but she must and did feel that her mother was\\r\\na partial, ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taught\\r\\nnor restrained her children, whose house was the scene of mismanagement\\r\\nand discomfort from beginning to end, and who had no talent, no\\r\\nconversation, no affection towards herself; no curiosity to know her\\r\\nbetter, no desire of her friendship, and no inclination for her company\\r\\nthat could lessen her sense of such feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was very anxious to be useful, and not to appear above her home,\\r\\nor in any way disqualified or disinclined, by her foreign education,\\r\\nfrom contributing her help to its comforts, and therefore set about\\r\\nworking for Sam immediately; and by working early and late, with\\r\\nperseverance and great despatch, did so much that the boy was shipped\\r\\noff at last, with more than half his linen ready. She had great pleasure\\r\\nin feeling her usefulness, but could not conceive how they would have\\r\\nmanaged without her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam, loud and overbearing as he was, she rather regretted when he went,\\r\\nfor he was clever and intelligent, and glad to be employed in any errand\\r\\nin the town; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan, given as\\r\\nthey were, though very reasonable in themselves, with ill-timed and\\r\\npowerless warmth, was beginning to be influenced by Fanny's services\\r\\nand gentle persuasions; and she found that the best of the three younger\\r\\nones was gone in him: Tom and Charles being at least as many years as\\r\\nthey were his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason, which\\r\\nmight suggest the expediency of making friends, and of endeavouring to\\r\\nbe less disagreeable. Their sister soon despaired of making the smallest\\r\\nimpression on _them_; they were quite untameable by any means of address\\r\\nwhich she had spirits or time to attempt. Every afternoon brought a\\r\\nreturn of their riotous games all over the house; and she very early\\r\\nlearned to sigh at the approach of Saturday's constant half-holiday.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the alphabet her\\r\\ngreatest enemy, left to be with the servants at her pleasure, and\\r\\nthen encouraged to report any evil of them, she was almost as ready to\\r\\ndespair of being able to love or assist; and of Susan's temper she\\r\\nhad many doubts. Her continual disagreements with her mother, her rash\\r\\nsquabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at least\\r\\nso distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no means\\r\\nwithout provocation, she feared the disposition that could push them to\\r\\nsuch length must be far from amiable, and from affording any repose to\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head, and\\r\\nteach her to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings. On the\\r\\ncontrary, she could think of nothing but Mansfield, its beloved inmates,\\r\\nits happy ways. Everything where she now was in full contrast to it. The\\r\\nelegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps, above all, the\\r\\npeace and tranquillity of Mansfield, were brought to her remembrance\\r\\nevery hour of the day, by the prevalence of everything opposite to them\\r\\n_here_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper delicate and\\r\\nnervous like Fanny's, an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony\\r\\ncould have entirely atoned for. It was the greatest misery of all. At\\r\\nMansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice, no abrupt bursts,\\r\\nno tread of violence, was ever heard; all proceeded in a regular course\\r\\nof cheerful orderliness; everybody had their due importance; everybody's\\r\\nfeelings were consulted. If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting,\\r\\ngood sense and good breeding supplied its place; and as to the little\\r\\nirritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris, they were short, they\\r\\nwere trifling, they were as a drop of water to the ocean, compared with\\r\\nthe ceaseless tumult of her present abode. Here everybody was noisy,\\r\\nevery voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her mother's, which resembled\\r\\nthe soft monotony of Lady Bertram's, only worn into fretfulness).\\r\\nWhatever was wanted was hallooed for, and the servants hallooed out\\r\\ntheir excuses from the kitchen. The doors were in constant banging, the\\r\\nstairs were never at rest, nothing was done without a clatter, nobody\\r\\nsat still, and nobody could command attention when they spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her before the end\\r\\nof a week, Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson's celebrated\\r\\njudgment as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield\\r\\nPark might have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XL\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now\\r\\nat the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun; Mary's next\\r\\nletter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last, but she\\r\\nwas not right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great\\r\\nrelief to herself. Here was another strange revolution of mind! She was\\r\\nreally glad to receive the letter when it did come. In her present exile\\r\\nfrom good society, and distance from everything that had been wont to\\r\\ninterest her, a letter from one belonging to the set where her heart\\r\\nlived, written with affection, and some degree of elegance, was\\r\\nthoroughly acceptable. The usual plea of increasing engagements was made\\r\\nin excuse for not having written to her earlier; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now that I have\\r\\nbegun,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy letter will not be worth your reading, for\\r\\nthere will be no little offering of love at the end, no three or four\\r\\nlines _passionnees_ from the most devoted H. C. in the world, for\\r\\nHenry is in Norfolk; business called him to Everingham ten days ago, or\\r\\nperhaps he only pretended to call, for the sake of being travelling\\r\\nat the same time that you were. But there he is, and, by the bye, his\\r\\nabsence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister's in\\r\\nwriting, for there has been no 'Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny?\\r\\nIs not it time for you to write to Fanny?' to spur me on. At last, after\\r\\nvarious attempts at meeting, I have seen your cousins, 'dear Julia and\\r\\ndearest Mrs. Rushworth'; they found me at home yesterday, and we were\\r\\nglad to see each other again. We _seemed_ _very_ glad to see each other,\\r\\nand I do really think we were a little. We had a vast deal to say. Shall\\r\\nI tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned? I did\\r\\nnot use to think her wanting in self-possession, but she had not quite\\r\\nenough for the demands of yesterday. Upon the whole, Julia was in the\\r\\nbest looks of the two, at least after you were spoken of. There was no\\r\\nrecovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of 'Fanny,' and\\r\\nspoke of her as a sister should. But Mrs. Rushworth's day of good looks\\r\\nwill come; we have cards for her first party on the 28th. Then she\\r\\nwill be in beauty, for she will open one of the best houses in Wimpole\\r\\nStreet. I was in it two years ago, when it was Lady Lascelle's, and\\r\\nprefer it to almost any I know in London, and certainly she will then\\r\\nfeel, to use a vulgar phrase, that she has got her pennyworth for her\\r\\npenny. Henry could not have afforded her such a house. I hope she will\\r\\nrecollect it, and be satisfied, as well as she may, with moving the\\r\\nqueen of a palace, though the king may appear best in the background;\\r\\nand as I have no desire to tease her, I shall never _force_ your name\\r\\nupon her again. She will grow sober by degrees. From all that I hear\\r\\nand guess, Baron Wildenheim's attentions to Julia continue, but I do not\\r\\nknow that he has any serious encouragement. She ought to do better.\\r\\nA poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot imagine any liking in the\\r\\ncase, for take away his rants, and the poor baron has nothing. What a\\r\\ndifference a vowel makes! If his rents were but equal to his rants! Your\\r\\ncousin Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by parish duties. There\\r\\nmay be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted. I am unwilling\\r\\nto fancy myself neglected for a _young_ one. Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny,\\r\\nthis is a long letter from London: write me a pretty one in reply to\\r\\ngladden Henry's eyes, when he comes back, and send me an account of all\\r\\nthe dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was great food for meditation in this letter, and chiefly for\\r\\nunpleasant meditation; and yet, with all the uneasiness it supplied, it\\r\\nconnected her with the absent, it told her of people and things about\\r\\nwhom she had never felt so much curiosity as now, and she would\\r\\nhave been glad to have been sure of such a letter every week. Her\\r\\ncorrespondence with her aunt Bertram was her only concern of higher\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for any society in Portsmouth, that could at all make amends for\\r\\ndeficiencies at home, there were none within the circle of her father's\\r\\nand mother's acquaintance to afford her the smallest satisfaction: she\\r\\nsaw nobody in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own shyness\\r\\nand reserve. The men appeared to her all coarse, the women all pert,\\r\\neverybody underbred; and she gave as little contentment as she received\\r\\nfrom introductions either to old or new acquaintance. The young ladies\\r\\nwho approached her at first with some respect, in consideration of her\\r\\ncoming from a baronet's family, were soon offended by what they termed\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cairs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; for, as she neither played on the pianoforte nor wore fine\\r\\npelisses, they could, on farther observation, admit no right of\\r\\nsuperiority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home,\\r\\nthe first which her judgment could entirely approve, and which gave any\\r\\npromise of durability, was in a better knowledge of Susan, and a hope of\\r\\nbeing of service to her. Susan had always behaved pleasantly to herself,\\r\\nbut the determined character of her general manners had astonished\\r\\nand alarmed her, and it was at least a fortnight before she began to\\r\\nunderstand a disposition so totally different from her own. Susan saw\\r\\nthat much was wrong at home, and wanted to set it right. That a girl of\\r\\nfourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason, should err in the\\r\\nmethod of reform, was not wonderful; and Fanny soon became more disposed\\r\\nto admire the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguish\\r\\njustly, than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led.\\r\\nSusan was only acting on the same truths, and pursuing the same system,\\r\\nwhich her own judgment acknowledged, but which her more supine and\\r\\nyielding temper would have shrunk from asserting. Susan tried to be\\r\\nuseful, where _she_ could only have gone away and cried; and that Susan\\r\\nwas useful she could perceive; that things, bad as they were, would\\r\\nhave been worse but for such interposition, and that both her mother and\\r\\nBetsey were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgence\\r\\nand vulgarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every argument with her mother, Susan had in point of reason the\\r\\nadvantage, and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off.\\r\\nThe blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she had\\r\\nnever known. There was no gratitude for affection past or present to\\r\\nmake her better bear with its excesses to the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this became gradually evident, and gradually placed Susan before her\\r\\nsister as an object of mingled compassion and respect. That her manner\\r\\nwas wrong, however, at times very wrong, her measures often ill-chosen\\r\\nand ill-timed, and her looks and language very often indefensible, Fanny\\r\\ncould not cease to feel; but she began to hope they might be rectified.\\r\\nSusan, she found, looked up to her and wished for her good opinion; and\\r\\nnew as anything like an office of authority was to Fanny, new as it\\r\\nwas to imagine herself capable of guiding or informing any one, she did\\r\\nresolve to give occasional hints to Susan, and endeavour to exercise for\\r\\nher advantage the juster notions of what was due to everybody, and what\\r\\nwould be wisest for herself, which her own more favoured education had\\r\\nfixed in her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer influence, or at least the consciousness and use of it, originated\\r\\nin an act of kindness by Susan, which, after many hesitations of\\r\\ndelicacy, she at last worked herself up to. It had very early occurred\\r\\nto her that a small sum of money might, perhaps, restore peace for\\r\\never on the sore subject of the silver knife, canvassed as it now was\\r\\ncontinually, and the riches which she was in possession of herself,\\r\\nher uncle having given her 10 pounds at parting, made her as able as she was\\r\\nwilling to be generous. But she was so wholly unused to confer favours,\\r\\nexcept on the very poor, so unpractised in removing evils, or bestowing\\r\\nkindnesses among her equals, and so fearful of appearing to elevate\\r\\nherself as a great lady at home, that it took some time to determine\\r\\nthat it would not be unbecoming in her to make such a present. It\\r\\nwas made, however, at last: a silver knife was bought for Betsey, and\\r\\naccepted with great delight, its newness giving it every advantage\\r\\nover the other that could be desired; Susan was established in the full\\r\\npossession of her own, Betsey handsomely declaring that now she had got\\r\\none so much prettier herself, she should never want _that_ again; and\\r\\nno reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother, which Fanny\\r\\nhad almost feared to be impossible. The deed thoroughly answered: a\\r\\nsource of domestic altercation was entirely done away, and it was the\\r\\nmeans of opening Susan's heart to her, and giving her something more to\\r\\nlove and be interested in. Susan shewed that she had delicacy: pleased\\r\\nas she was to be mistress of property which she had been struggling for\\r\\nat least two years, she yet feared that her sister's judgment had been\\r\\nagainst her, and that a reproof was designed her for having so struggled\\r\\nas to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer temper was open. She acknowledged her fears, blamed herself for\\r\\nhaving contended so warmly; and from that hour Fanny, understanding the\\r\\nworth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to\\r\\nseek her good opinion and refer to her judgment, began to feel again the\\r\\nblessing of affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to a\\r\\nmind so much in need of help, and so much deserving it. She gave advice,\\r\\nadvice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding, and given so\\r\\nmildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect temper, and she\\r\\nhad the happiness of observing its good effects not unfrequently.\\r\\nMore was not expected by one who, while seeing all the obligation and\\r\\nexpediency of submission and forbearance, saw also with sympathetic\\r\\nacuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating to a girl like\\r\\nSusan. Her greatest wonder on the subject soon became--not that Susan\\r\\nshould have been provoked into disrespect and impatience against her\\r\\nbetter knowledge--but that so much better knowledge, so many good\\r\\nnotions should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in the midst\\r\\nof negligence and error, she should have formed such proper opinions\\r\\nof what ought to be; she, who had had no cousin Edmund to direct her\\r\\nthoughts or fix her principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intimacy thus begun between them was a material advantage to\\r\\neach. By sitting together upstairs, they avoided a great deal of the\\r\\ndisturbance of the house; Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think it\\r\\nno misfortune to be quietly employed. They sat without a fire; but\\r\\nthat was a privation familiar even to Fanny, and she suffered the\\r\\nless because reminded by it of the East room. It was the only point of\\r\\nresemblance. In space, light, furniture, and prospect, there was\\r\\nnothing alike in the two apartments; and she often heaved a sigh at the\\r\\nremembrance of all her books and boxes, and various comforts there. By\\r\\ndegrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs, at\\r\\nfirst only in working and talking, but after a few days, the remembrance\\r\\nof the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny found it\\r\\nimpossible not to try for books again. There were none in her father's\\r\\nhouse; but wealth is luxurious and daring, and some of hers found its\\r\\nway to a circulating library. She became a subscriber; amazed at being\\r\\nanything _in propria persona_, amazed at her own doings in every way, to\\r\\nbe a renter, a chuser of books! And to be having any one's improvement\\r\\nin view in her choice! But so it was. Susan had read nothing, and Fanny\\r\\nlonged to give her a share in her own first pleasures, and inspire a\\r\\ntaste for the biography and poetry which she delighted in herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this occupation she hoped, moreover, to bury some of the\\r\\nrecollections of Mansfield, which were too apt to seize her mind if her\\r\\nfingers only were busy; and, especially at this time, hoped it might\\r\\nbe useful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London,\\r\\nwhither, on the authority of her aunt's last letter, she knew he was\\r\\ngone. She had no doubt of what would ensue. The promised notification\\r\\nwas hanging over her head. The postman's knock within the neighbourhood\\r\\nwas beginning to bring its daily terrors, and if reading could banish\\r\\nthe idea for even half an hour, it was something gained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLI\\r\\n\\r\\nA week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town, and Fanny had\\r\\nheard nothing of him. There were three different conclusions to be drawn\\r\\nfrom his silence, between which her mind was in fluctuation; each of\\r\\nthem at times being held the most probable. Either his going had been\\r\\nagain delayed, or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss\\r\\nCrawford alone, or he was too happy for letter-writing!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly four weeks\\r\\nfrom Mansfield, a point which she never failed to think over and\\r\\ncalculate every day, as she and Susan were preparing to remove, as\\r\\nusual, upstairs, they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they\\r\\nfelt they could not avoid, from Rebecca's alertness in going to the\\r\\ndoor, a duty which always interested her beyond any other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a gentleman's voice; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning\\r\\npale about, when Mr. Crawford walked into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood sense, like hers, will always act when really called upon; and she\\r\\nfound that she had been able to name him to her mother, and recall her\\r\\nremembrance of the name, as that of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWilliam's friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d though she could\\r\\nnot previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable\\r\\nat such a moment. The consciousness of his being known there only as\\r\\nWilliam's friend was some support. Having introduced him, however, and\\r\\nbeing all reseated, the terrors that occurred of what this visit might\\r\\nlead to were overpowering, and she fancied herself on the point of\\r\\nfainting away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile trying to keep herself alive, their visitor, who had at first\\r\\napproached her with as animated a countenance as ever, was wisely and\\r\\nkindly keeping his eyes away, and giving her time to recover, while he\\r\\ndevoted himself entirely to her mother, addressing her, and attending\\r\\nto her with the utmost politeness and propriety, at the same time with\\r\\na degree of friendliness, of interest at least, which was making his\\r\\nmanner perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Price's manners were also at their best. Warmed by the sight of\\r\\nsuch a friend to her son, and regulated by the wish of appearing to\\r\\nadvantage before him, she was overflowing with gratitude--artless,\\r\\nmaternal gratitude--which could not be unpleasing. Mr. Price was out,\\r\\nwhich she regretted very much. Fanny was just recovered enough to\\r\\nfeel that _she_ could not regret it; for to her many other sources of\\r\\nuneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he\\r\\nfound her. She might scold herself for the weakness, but there was no\\r\\nscolding it away. She was ashamed, and she would have been yet more\\r\\nashamed of her father than of all the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire;\\r\\nand Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could\\r\\nwish. She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life;\\r\\nand was only astonished to find that, so great and so agreeable as he\\r\\nwas, he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the\\r\\nport-admiral, nor the commissioner, nor yet with the intention of going\\r\\nover to the island, nor of seeing the dockyard. Nothing of all that she\\r\\nhad been used to think of as the proof of importance, or the employment\\r\\nof wealth, had brought him to Portsmouth. He had reached it late the\\r\\nnight before, was come for a day or two, was staying at the Crown, had\\r\\naccidentally met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since\\r\\nhis arrival, but had no object of that kind in coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonable\\r\\nto suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she was\\r\\ntolerably able to bear his eye, and hear that he had spent half an hour\\r\\nwith his sister the evening before his leaving London; that she had\\r\\nsent her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that he\\r\\nthought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having spent\\r\\nscarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his return from Norfolk,\\r\\nbefore he set off again; that her cousin Edmund was in town, had been in\\r\\ntown, he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him himself, but\\r\\nthat he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and was to dine,\\r\\nas yesterday, with the Frasers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned circumstance;\\r\\nnay, it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty; and the\\r\\nwords, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen by this time it is all settled,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d passed internally, without\\r\\nmore evidence of emotion than a faint blush.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject in which her\\r\\ninterest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at the expediency of\\r\\nan early walk. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a lovely morning, and at that season of the year\\r\\na fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody\\r\\nnot to delay their exercise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and such hints producing nothing, he soon\\r\\nproceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her\\r\\ndaughters to take their walk without loss of time. Now they came to an\\r\\nunderstanding. Mrs. Price, it appeared, scarcely ever stirred out of\\r\\ndoors, except of a Sunday; she owned she could seldom, with her large\\r\\nfamily, find time for a walk. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould she not, then, persuade her\\r\\ndaughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him the pleasure\\r\\nof attending them?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place; they\\r\\ndid not often get out; and she knew they had some errands in the town,\\r\\nwhich they would be very glad to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And the consequence was, that\\r\\nFanny, strange as it was--strange, awkward, and distressing--found\\r\\nherself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street\\r\\nwith Mr. Crawford.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion; for they were\\r\\nhardly in the High Street before they met her father, whose\\r\\nappearance was not the better from its being Saturday. He stopt; and,\\r\\nungentlemanlike as he looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr.\\r\\nCrawford. She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford\\r\\nmust be struck. He must be ashamed and disgusted altogether. He must\\r\\nsoon give her up, and cease to have the smallest inclination for the\\r\\nmatch; and yet, though she had been so much wanting his affection to\\r\\nbe cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the\\r\\ncomplaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United\\r\\nKingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought\\r\\nby a clever, agreeable man, than have him driven away by the vulgarity\\r\\nof her nearest relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father-in-law with any\\r\\nidea of taking him for a model in dress; but (as Fanny instantly, and to\\r\\nher great relief, discerned) her father was a very different man, a\\r\\nvery different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected\\r\\nstranger, from what he was in his own family at home. His manners\\r\\nnow, though not polished, were more than passable: they were grateful,\\r\\nanimated, manly; his expressions were those of an attached father, and\\r\\na sensible man; his loud tones did very well in the open air, and there\\r\\nwas not a single oath to be heard. Such was his instinctive compliment\\r\\nto the good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the consequence what it\\r\\nmight, Fanny's immediate feelings were infinitely soothed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conclusion of the two gentlemen's civilities was an offer of Mr.\\r\\nPrice's to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford,\\r\\ndesirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though\\r\\nhe had seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much the\\r\\nlonger with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, if\\r\\nthe Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow or\\r\\nother ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they were\\r\\nnot at all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but for\\r\\nMr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without the\\r\\nsmallest consideration for his daughters' errands in the High Street. He\\r\\ntook care, however, that they should be allowed to go to the shops they\\r\\ncame out expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long, for Fanny\\r\\ncould so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for, that before\\r\\nthe gentlemen, as they stood at the door, could do more than begin upon\\r\\nthe last naval regulations, or settle the number of three-deckers now in\\r\\ncommission, their companions were ready to proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were then to set forward for the dockyard at once, and the walk\\r\\nwould have been conducted--according to Mr. Crawford's opinion--in a\\r\\nsingular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it,\\r\\nas the two girls, he found, would have been left to follow, and keep up\\r\\nwith them or not, as they could, while they walked on together at their\\r\\nown hasty pace. He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally,\\r\\nthough by no means to the extent he wished; he absolutely would not walk\\r\\naway from them; and at any crossing or any crowd, when Mr. Price was\\r\\nonly calling out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue, take care of\\r\\nyourselves; keep a sharp lookout!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he would give them his particular\\r\\nattendance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce fairly in the dockyard, he began to reckon upon some happy\\r\\nintercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a brother\\r\\nlounger of Mr. Price's, who was come to take his daily survey of how\\r\\nthings went on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion than\\r\\nhimself; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied\\r\\ngoing about together, and discussing matters of equal and never-failing\\r\\ninterest, while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard,\\r\\nor found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to\\r\\nlook at. Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest. Crawford could not\\r\\nhave wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down; but he could\\r\\nhave wished her sister away. A quick-looking girl of Susan's age was the\\r\\nvery worst third in the world: totally different from Lady Bertram, all\\r\\neyes and ears; and there was no introducing the main point before her.\\r\\nHe must content himself with being only generally agreeable, and letting\\r\\nSusan have her share of entertainment, with the indulgence, now and\\r\\nthen, of a look or hint for the better-informed and conscious Fanny.\\r\\nNorfolk was what he had mostly to talk of: there he had been some time,\\r\\nand everything there was rising in importance from his present schemes.\\r\\nSuch a man could come from no place, no society, without importing\\r\\nsomething to amuse; his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use,\\r\\nand Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her. For Fanny, somewhat\\r\\nmore was related than the accidental agreeableness of the parties he had\\r\\nbeen in. For her approbation, the particular reason of his going into\\r\\nNorfolk at all, at this unusual time of year, was given. It had been\\r\\nreal business, relative to the renewal of a lease in which the welfare\\r\\nof a large and--he believed--industrious family was at stake. He had\\r\\nsuspected his agent of some underhand dealing; of meaning to bias\\r\\nhim against the deserving; and he had determined to go himself, and\\r\\nthoroughly investigate the merits of the case. He had gone, had done\\r\\neven more good than he had foreseen, had been useful to more than his\\r\\nfirst plan had comprehended, and was now able to congratulate himself\\r\\nupon it, and to feel that in performing a duty, he had secured agreeable\\r\\nrecollections for his own mind. He had introduced himself to some\\r\\ntenants whom he had never seen before; he had begun making acquaintance\\r\\nwith cottages whose very existence, though on his own estate, had been\\r\\nhitherto unknown to him. This was aimed, and well aimed, at Fanny. It\\r\\nwas pleasing to hear him speak so properly; here he had been acting as\\r\\nhe ought to do. To be the friend of the poor and the oppressed! Nothing\\r\\ncould be more grateful to her; and she was on the point of giving him an\\r\\napproving look, when it was all frightened off by his adding a something\\r\\ntoo pointed of his hoping soon to have an assistant, a friend, a guide\\r\\nin every plan of utility or charity for Everingham: a somebody that\\r\\nwould make Everingham and all about it a dearer object than it had ever\\r\\nbeen yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned away, and wished he would not say such things. She was\\r\\nwilling to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been\\r\\nwont to suppose. She began to feel the possibility of his turning out\\r\\nwell at last; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her,\\r\\nand ought not to think of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe perceived that enough had been said of Everingham, and that it would\\r\\nbe as well to talk of something else, and turned to Mansfield. He could\\r\\nnot have chosen better; that was a topic to bring back her attention and\\r\\nher looks almost instantly. It was a real indulgence to her to hear or\\r\\nto speak of Mansfield. Now so long divided from everybody who knew the\\r\\nplace, she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it,\\r\\nand led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and\\r\\ncomforts, and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her\\r\\nto gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium, in speaking of her\\r\\nuncle as all that was clever and good, and her aunt as having the\\r\\nsweetest of all sweet tempers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had a great attachment to Mansfield himself; he said so; he looked\\r\\nforward with the hope of spending much, very much, of his time there;\\r\\nalways there, or in the neighbourhood. He particularly built upon a very\\r\\nhappy summer and autumn there this year; he felt that it would be so: he\\r\\ndepended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the last.\\r\\nAs animated, as diversified, as social, but with circumstances of\\r\\nsuperiority undescribable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMansfield, Sotherton, Thornton Lacey,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat a society\\r\\nwill be comprised in those houses! And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourth\\r\\nmay be added: some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything so\\r\\ndear; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund Bertram\\r\\nonce good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee two objections: two\\r\\nfair, excellent, irresistible objections to that plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was doubly silenced here; though when the moment was passed,\\r\\ncould regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged\\r\\ncomprehension of one half of his meaning, and encouraged him to say\\r\\nsomething more of his sister and Edmund. It was a subject which she must\\r\\nlearn to speak of, and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon be\\r\\nquite unpardonable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished, or had time\\r\\nfor, the others were ready to return; and in the course of their walk\\r\\nback, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute's privacy for telling Fanny that\\r\\nhis only business in Portsmouth was to see her; that he was come down\\r\\nfor a couple of days on her account, and hers only, and because he could\\r\\nnot endure a longer total separation. She was sorry, really sorry; and\\r\\nyet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished\\r\\nhe had not said, she thought him altogether improved since she had seen\\r\\nhim; he was much more gentle, obliging, and attentive to other people's\\r\\nfeelings than he had ever been at Mansfield; she had never seen him so\\r\\nagreeable--so _near_ being agreeable; his behaviour to her father could\\r\\nnot offend, and there was something particularly kind and proper in the\\r\\nnotice he took of Susan. He was decidedly improved. She wished the next\\r\\nday over, she wished he had come only for one day; but it was not\\r\\nso very bad as she would have expected: the pleasure of talking of\\r\\nMansfield was so very great!\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they parted, she had to thank him for another pleasure, and one\\r\\nof no trivial kind. Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking\\r\\nhis mutton with them, and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror,\\r\\nbefore he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement. He was\\r\\nengaged to dinner already both for that day and the next; he had met\\r\\nwith some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied; he should\\r\\nhave the honour, however, of waiting on them again on the morrow, etc.,\\r\\nand so they parted--Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping so\\r\\nhorrible an evil!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo have had him join their family dinner-party, and see all their\\r\\ndeficiencies, would have been dreadful! Rebecca's cookery and Rebecca's\\r\\nwaiting, and Betsey's eating at table without restraint, and pulling\\r\\neverything about as she chose, were what Fanny herself was not yet\\r\\nenough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal. _She_ was nice\\r\\nonly from natural delicacy, but _he_ had been brought up in a school of\\r\\nluxury and epicurism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prices were just setting off for church the next day when Mr.\\r\\nCrawford appeared again. He came, not to stop, but to join them; he was\\r\\nasked to go with them to the Garrison chapel, which was exactly what he\\r\\nhad intended, and they all walked thither together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family were now seen to advantage. Nature had given them no\\r\\ninconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday dressed them in their\\r\\ncleanest skins and best attire. Sunday always brought this comfort to\\r\\nFanny, and on this Sunday she felt it more than ever. Her poor mother\\r\\nnow did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram's sister as she\\r\\nwas but too apt to look. It often grieved her to the heart to think of\\r\\nthe contrast between them; to think that where nature had made so little\\r\\ndifference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her mother,\\r\\nas handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior, should have an\\r\\nappearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so slatternly,\\r\\nso shabby. But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerably\\r\\ncheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family of\\r\\nchildren, feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only\\r\\ndiscomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by with\\r\\na flower in her hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford took care not to\\r\\nbe divided from the female branch; and after chapel he still continued\\r\\nwith them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday\\r\\nthroughout the year, always going directly after morning service and\\r\\nstaying till dinner-time. It was her public place: there she met her\\r\\nacquaintance, heard a little news, talked over the badness of the\\r\\nPortsmouth servants, and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss\\r\\nPrices as his peculiar charge; and before they had been there long,\\r\\nsomehow or other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have believed\\r\\nit, but he was walking between them with an arm of each under his,\\r\\nand she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it. It made her\\r\\nuncomfortable for a time, but yet there were enjoyments in the day and\\r\\nin the view which would be felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was uncommonly lovely. It was really March; but it was April in\\r\\nits mild air, brisk soft wind, and bright sun, occasionally clouded for\\r\\na minute; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of such\\r\\na sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships at\\r\\nSpithead and the island beyond, with the ever-varying hues of the sea,\\r\\nnow at high water, dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts\\r\\nwith so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination of charms\\r\\nfor Fanny, as made her gradually almost careless of the circumstances\\r\\nunder which she felt them. Nay, had she been without his arm, she would\\r\\nsoon have known that she needed it, for she wanted strength for a two\\r\\nhours' saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally did, upon a week's\\r\\nprevious inactivity. Fanny was beginning to feel the effect of being\\r\\ndebarred from her usual regular exercise; she had lost ground as to\\r\\nhealth since her being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr. Crawford and the\\r\\nbeauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up now.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loveliness of the day, and of the view, he felt like herself. They\\r\\noften stopt with the same sentiment and taste, leaning against the wall,\\r\\nsome minutes, to look and admire; and considering he was not Edmund,\\r\\nFanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the charms\\r\\nof nature, and very well able to express his admiration. She had a few\\r\\ntender reveries now and then, which he could sometimes take advantage\\r\\nof to look in her face without detection; and the result of these looks\\r\\nwas, that though as bewitching as ever, her face was less blooming than\\r\\nit ought to be. She _said_ she was very well, and did not like to be\\r\\nsupposed otherwise; but take it all in all, he was convinced that her\\r\\npresent residence could not be comfortable, and therefore could not\\r\\nbe salutary for her, and he was growing anxious for her being again at\\r\\nMansfield, where her own happiness, and his in seeing her, must be so\\r\\nmuch greater.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have been here a month, I think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo; not quite a month. It is only four weeks to-morrow since I left\\r\\nMansfield.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are a most accurate and honest reckoner. I should call that a\\r\\nmonth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not arrive here till Tuesday evening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it is to be a two months' visit, is not?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. My uncle talked of two months. I suppose it will not be less.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd how are you to be conveyed back again? Who comes for you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt. Perhaps\\r\\nI may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for me to be fetched\\r\\nexactly at the two months' end.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a moment's reflection, Mr. Crawford replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know Mansfield, I\\r\\nknow its way, I know its faults towards _you_. I know the danger of\\r\\nyour being so far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the\\r\\nimaginary convenience of any single being in the family. I am aware\\r\\nthat you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas cannot settle\\r\\neverything for coming himself, or sending your aunt's maid for you,\\r\\nwithout involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he\\r\\nmay have laid down for the next quarter of a year. This will not do. Two\\r\\nmonths is an ample allowance; I should think six weeks quite enough.\\r\\nI am considering your sister's health,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, addressing himself to\\r\\nSusan, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to. She\\r\\nrequires constant air and exercise. When you know her as well as I do,\\r\\nI am sure you will agree that she does, and that she ought never to\\r\\nbe long banished from the free air and liberty of the country. If,\\r\\ntherefore\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (turning again to Fanny), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou find yourself growing unwell,\\r\\nand any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield, without\\r\\nwaiting for the two months to be ended, _that_ must not be regarded\\r\\nas of any consequence, if you feel yourself at all less strong or\\r\\ncomfortable than usual, and will only let my sister know it, give her\\r\\nonly the slightest hint, she and I will immediately come down, and take\\r\\nyou back to Mansfield. You know the ease and the pleasure with which\\r\\nthis would be done. You know all that would be felt on the occasion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny thanked him, but tried to laugh it off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am perfectly serious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas you perfectly know. And I\\r\\nhope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition.\\r\\nIndeed, you shall _not_; it shall not be in your power; for so long only\\r\\nas you positively say, in every letter to Mary, 'I am well,' and I\\r\\nknow you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long only shall you be\\r\\nconsidered as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny thanked him again, but was affected and distressed to a degree\\r\\nthat made it impossible for her to say much, or even to be certain of\\r\\nwhat she ought to say. This was towards the close of their walk. He\\r\\nattended them to the last, and left them only at the door of their own\\r\\nhouse, when he knew them to be going to dinner, and therefore pretended\\r\\nto be waited for elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish you were not so tired,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, still detaining Fanny after all\\r\\nthe others were in the house--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish I left you in stronger health. Is\\r\\nthere anything I can do for you in town? I have half an idea of going\\r\\ninto Norfolk again soon. I am not satisfied about Maddison. I am sure\\r\\nhe still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of his own\\r\\ninto a certain mill, which I design for somebody else. I must come to an\\r\\nunderstanding with him. I must make him know that I will not be tricked\\r\\non the south side of Everingham, any more than on the north: that I will\\r\\nbe master of my own property. I was not explicit enough with him before.\\r\\nThe mischief such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of his\\r\\nemployer and the welfare of the poor, is inconceivable. I have a great\\r\\nmind to go back into Norfolk directly, and put everything at once on\\r\\nsuch a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from. Maddison is a\\r\\nclever fellow; I do not wish to displace him, provided he does not try\\r\\nto displace _me_; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no\\r\\nright of creditor to dupe me, and worse than simple to let him give me a\\r\\nhard-hearted, griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man,\\r\\nto whom I have given half a promise already. Would it not be worse than\\r\\nsimple? Shall I go? Do you advise it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI advise! You know very well what is right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes. When you give me your opinion, I always know what is right. Your\\r\\njudgment is my rule of right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, no! do not say so. We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we\\r\\nwould attend to it, than any other person can be. Good-bye; I wish you a\\r\\npleasant journey to-morrow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs there nothing I can do for you in town?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing; I am much obliged to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you no message for anybody?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my\\r\\ncousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I\\r\\nshall soon hear from him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excuses\\r\\nmyself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained. He pressed\\r\\nher hand, looked at her, and was gone. _He_ went to while away the next\\r\\nthree hours as he could, with his other acquaintance, till the best\\r\\ndinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment, and\\r\\n_she_ turned in to her more simple one immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir general fare bore a very different character; and could he have\\r\\nsuspected how many privations, besides that of exercise, she endured in\\r\\nher father's house, he would have wondered that her looks were not much\\r\\nmore affected than he found them. She was so little equal to Rebecca's\\r\\npuddings and Rebecca's hashes, brought to table, as they all were, with\\r\\nsuch accompaniments of half-cleaned plates, and not half-cleaned knives\\r\\nand forks, that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest\\r\\nmeal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and\\r\\nbuns. After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the day\\r\\nto be hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he known all,\\r\\nmight have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved,\\r\\nboth mind and body, into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford's good\\r\\ncompany and good fortune, he would probably have feared to push his\\r\\nexperiment farther, lest she might die under the cure.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day. Though tolerably\\r\\nsecure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again, she could not help being low.\\r\\nIt was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend; and though, in\\r\\none light, glad to have him gone, it seemed as if she was now deserted\\r\\nby everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield; and\\r\\nshe could not think of his returning to town, and being frequently with\\r\\nMary and Edmund, without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate\\r\\nherself for having them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her; a\\r\\nfriend or two of her father's, as always happened if he was not with\\r\\nthem, spent the long, long evening there; and from six o'clock till\\r\\nhalf-past nine, there was little intermission of noise or grog. She\\r\\nwas very low. The wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr.\\r\\nCrawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within the\\r\\ncurrent of her thoughts. Not considering in how different a circle she\\r\\nhad been just seeing him, nor how much might be owing to contrast, she\\r\\nwas quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful\\r\\nof others than formerly. And, if in little things, must it not be so in\\r\\ngreat? So anxious for her health and comfort, so very feeling as he now\\r\\nexpressed himself, and really seemed, might not it be fairly supposed\\r\\nthat he would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIII\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back, to London, on the\\r\\nmorrow, for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price's; and two days\\r\\nafterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter\\r\\nfrom his sister, opened and read by her, on another account, with the\\r\\nmost anxious curiosity:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry has been down to\\r\\nPortsmouth to see you; that he had a delightful walk with you to the\\r\\ndockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the next day,\\r\\non the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweet\\r\\nlooks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony,\\r\\nand afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.\\r\\nThis, as well as I understand, is to be the substance of my information.\\r\\nHe makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be communicated,\\r\\nexcept this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said walks, and his\\r\\nintroduction to your family, especially to a fair sister of yours, a\\r\\nfine girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts, taking her\\r\\nfirst lesson, I presume, in love. I have not time for writing much, but\\r\\nit would be out of place if I had, for this is to be a mere letter of\\r\\nbusiness, penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information,\\r\\nwhich could not be delayed without risk of evil. My dear, dear Fanny,\\r\\nif I had you here, how I would talk to you! You should listen to me till\\r\\nyou were tired, and advise me till you were still tired more; but it is\\r\\nimpossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper, so I will\\r\\nabstain altogether, and leave you to guess what you like. I have no news\\r\\nfor you. You have politics, of course; and it would be too bad to plague\\r\\nyou with the names of people and parties that fill up my time. I ought\\r\\nto have sent you an account of your cousin's first party, but I was\\r\\nlazy, and now it is too long ago; suffice it, that everything was just\\r\\nas it ought to be, in a style that any of her connexions must have been\\r\\ngratified to witness, and that her own dress and manners did her the\\r\\ngreatest credit. My friend, Mrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and it\\r\\nwould not make _me_ miserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter;\\r\\nshe seems in high spirits, and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is very\\r\\ngood-humoured and pleasant in his own family, and I do not think him so\\r\\nvery ill-looking as I did--at least, one sees many worse. He will not\\r\\ndo by the side of your cousin Edmund. Of the last-mentioned hero, what\\r\\nshall I say? If I avoided his name entirely, it would look suspicious.\\r\\nI will say, then, that we have seen him two or three times, and that\\r\\nmy friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance.\\r\\nMrs. Fraser (no bad judge) declares she knows but three men in town\\r\\nwho have so good a person, height, and air; and I must confess, when he\\r\\ndined here the other day, there were none to compare with him, and\\r\\nwe were a party of sixteen. Luckily there is no distinction of dress\\r\\nnowadays to tell tales, but--but--but Yours affectionately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had almost forgot (it was Edmund's fault: he gets into my head more\\r\\nthan does me good) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and\\r\\nmyself--I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire. My dear\\r\\nlittle creature, do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks.\\r\\nThose vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health. My poor aunt\\r\\nalways felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral\\r\\nof course never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service\\r\\nand Henry's, at an hour's notice. I should like the scheme, and we would\\r\\nmake a little circuit, and shew you Everingham in our way, and perhaps\\r\\nyou would not mind passing through London, and seeing the inside of St.\\r\\nGeorge's, Hanover Square. Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such\\r\\na time: I should not like to be tempted. What a long letter! one word\\r\\nmore. Henry, I find, has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon\\r\\nsome business that _you_ approve; but this cannot possibly be permitted\\r\\nbefore the middle of next week; that is, he cannot anyhow be spared till\\r\\nafter the 14th, for _we_ have a party that evening. The value of a man\\r\\nlike Henry, on such an occasion, is what you can have no conception\\r\\nof; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable. He will see the\\r\\nRushworths, which own I am not sorry for--having a little curiosity, and\\r\\nso I think has he--though he will not acknowledge it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be read deliberately,\\r\\nto supply matter for much reflection, and to leave everything in greater\\r\\nsuspense than ever. The only certainty to be drawn from it was, that\\r\\nnothing decisive had yet taken place. Edmund had not yet spoken. How\\r\\nMiss Crawford really felt, how she meant to act, or might act without\\r\\nor against her meaning; whether his importance to her were quite what\\r\\nit had been before the last separation; whether, if lessened, it were\\r\\nlikely to lessen more, or to recover itself, were subjects for endless\\r\\nconjecture, and to be thought of on that day and many days to come,\\r\\nwithout producing any conclusion. The idea that returned the oftenest\\r\\nwas that Miss Crawford, after proving herself cooled and staggered by\\r\\na return to London habits, would yet prove herself in the end too much\\r\\nattached to him to give him up. She would try to be more ambitious than\\r\\nher heart would allow. She would hesitate, she would tease, she would\\r\\ncondition, she would require a great deal, but she would finally accept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was Fanny's most frequent expectation. A house in town--that, she\\r\\nthought, must be impossible. Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford\\r\\nmight not ask. The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse. The\\r\\nwoman who could speak of him, and speak only of his appearance! What an\\r\\nunworthy attachment! To be deriving support from the commendations of\\r\\nMrs. Fraser! _She_ who had known him intimately half a year! Fanny was\\r\\nashamed of her. Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr.\\r\\nCrawford and herself, touched her, in comparison, slightly. Whether Mr.\\r\\nCrawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no\\r\\nconcern of hers, though, everything considered, she thought he _would_\\r\\ngo without delay. That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a\\r\\nmeeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of\\r\\nconduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_ would\\r\\nnot be actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He acknowledged no such\\r\\ninducement, and his sister ought to have given him credit for better\\r\\nfeelings than her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving\\r\\nthis than she had been before; and for a few days was so unsettled by\\r\\nit altogether, by what had come, and what might come, that her usual\\r\\nreadings and conversation with Susan were much suspended. She could\\r\\nnot command her attention as she wished. If Mr. Crawford remembered her\\r\\nmessage to her cousin, she thought it very likely, most likely, that he\\r\\nwould write to her at all events; it would be most consistent with his\\r\\nusual kindness; and till she got rid of this idea, till it gradually\\r\\nwore off, by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days\\r\\nmore, she was in a most restless, anxious state.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, a something like composure succeeded. Suspense must be\\r\\nsubmitted to, and must not be allowed to wear her out, and make her\\r\\nuseless. Time did something, her own exertions something more, and she\\r\\nresumed her attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same interest in\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was growing very fond of her, and though without any of the early\\r\\ndelight in books which had been so strong in Fanny, with a disposition\\r\\nmuch less inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for\\r\\ninformation's sake, she had so strong a desire of not _appearing_\\r\\nignorant, as, with a good clear understanding, made her a most\\r\\nattentive, profitable, thankful pupil. Fanny was her oracle. Fanny's\\r\\nexplanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay,\\r\\nor every chapter of history. What Fanny told her of former times dwelt\\r\\nmore on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she paid her sister\\r\\nthe compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author.\\r\\nThe early habit of reading was wanting.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir conversations, however, were not always on subjects so high as\\r\\nhistory or morals. Others had their hour; and of lesser matters, none\\r\\nreturned so often, or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park,\\r\\na description of the people, the manners, the amusements, the ways\\r\\nof Mansfield Park. Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel and\\r\\nwell-appointed, was eager to hear, and Fanny could not but indulge\\r\\nherself in dwelling on so beloved a theme. She hoped it was not wrong;\\r\\nthough, after a time, Susan's very great admiration of everything\\r\\nsaid or done in her uncle's house, and earnest longing to go into\\r\\nNorthamptonshire, seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings which\\r\\ncould not be gratified.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister;\\r\\nand as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this, she began to feel that\\r\\nwhen her own release from Portsmouth came, her happiness would have a\\r\\nmaterial drawback in leaving Susan behind. That a girl so capable of\\r\\nbeing made everything good should be left in such hands, distressed her\\r\\nmore and more. Were _she_ likely to have a home to invite her to, what\\r\\na blessing it would be! And had it been possible for her to return Mr.\\r\\nCrawford's regard, the probability of his being very far from objecting\\r\\nto such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her own\\r\\ncomforts. She thought he was really good-tempered, and could fancy his\\r\\nentering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIV\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone, when the one\\r\\nletter, the letter from Edmund, so long expected, was put into Fanny's\\r\\nhands. As she opened, and saw its length, she prepared herself for a\\r\\nminute detail of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards\\r\\nthe fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate. These were the\\r\\ncontents--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Dear Fanny,--Excuse me that I have not written before. Crawford told\\r\\nme that you were wishing to hear from me, but I found it impossible to\\r\\nwrite from London, and persuaded myself that you would understand my\\r\\nsilence. Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not have been\\r\\nwanting, but nothing of that nature was ever in my power. I am returned\\r\\nto Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it. My hopes are\\r\\nmuch weaker. You are probably aware of this already. So very fond of you\\r\\nas Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell you enough\\r\\nof her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine. I will not be\\r\\nprevented, however, from making my own communication. Our confidences in\\r\\nyou need not clash. I ask no questions. There is something soothing\\r\\nin the idea that we have the same friend, and that whatever unhappy\\r\\ndifferences of opinion may exist between us, we are united in our love\\r\\nof you. It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are, and\\r\\nwhat are my present plans, if plans I can be said to have. I have been\\r\\nreturned since Saturday. I was three weeks in London, and saw her (for\\r\\nLondon) very often. I had every attention from the Frasers that could be\\r\\nreasonably expected. I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with\\r\\nme hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield. It was her\\r\\nmanner, however, rather than any unfrequency of meeting. Had she been\\r\\ndifferent when I did see her, I should have made no complaint, but from\\r\\nthe very first she was altered: my first reception was so unlike what I\\r\\nhad hoped, that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly.\\r\\nI need not particularise. You know the weak side of her character, and\\r\\nmay imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me. She\\r\\nwas in high spirits, and surrounded by those who were giving all the\\r\\nsupport of their own bad sense to her too lively mind. I do not like\\r\\nMrs. Fraser. She is a cold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirely\\r\\nfrom convenience, and though evidently unhappy in her marriage,\\r\\nplaces her disappointment not to faults of judgment, or temper, or\\r\\ndisproportion of age, but to her being, after all, less affluent than\\r\\nmany of her acquaintance, especially than her sister, Lady Stornaway,\\r\\nand is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious,\\r\\nprovided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough. I look upon her\\r\\nintimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her life\\r\\nand mine. They have been leading her astray for years. Could she be\\r\\ndetached from them!--and sometimes I do not despair of it, for the\\r\\naffection appears to me principally on their side. They are very fond of\\r\\nher; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you. When I think\\r\\nof her great attachment to you, indeed, and the whole of her judicious,\\r\\nupright conduct as a sister, she appears a very different creature,\\r\\ncapable of everything noble, and I am ready to blame myself for a too\\r\\nharsh construction of a playful manner. I cannot give her up, Fanny. She\\r\\nis the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife. If\\r\\nI did not believe that she had some regard for me, of course I should\\r\\nnot say this, but I do believe it. I am convinced that she is not\\r\\nwithout a decided preference. I have no jealousy of any individual. It\\r\\nis the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous\\r\\nof. It is the habits of wealth that I fear. Her ideas are not higher\\r\\nthan her own fortune may warrant, but they are beyond what our incomes\\r\\nunited could authorise. There is comfort, however, even here. I could\\r\\nbetter bear to lose her because not rich enough, than because of my\\r\\nprofession. That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices,\\r\\nwhich, in fact, I am scarcely justified in asking; and, if I am refused,\\r\\nthat, I think, will be the honest motive. Her prejudices, I trust, are\\r\\nnot so strong as they were. You have my thoughts exactly as they arise,\\r\\nmy dear Fanny; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory, but it will\\r\\nnot be a less faithful picture of my mind. Having once begun, it is a\\r\\npleasure to me to tell you all I feel. I cannot give her up. Connected\\r\\nas we already are, and, I hope, are to be, to give up Mary Crawford\\r\\nwould be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me; to\\r\\nbanish myself from the very houses and friends whom, under any other\\r\\ndistress, I should turn to for consolation. The loss of Mary I must\\r\\nconsider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny. Were it a\\r\\ndecided thing, an actual refusal, I hope I should know how to bear it,\\r\\nand how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart, and in the course\\r\\nof a few years--but I am writing nonsense. Were I refused, I must bear\\r\\nit; and till I am, I can never cease to try for her. This is the truth.\\r\\nThe only question is _how_? What may be the likeliest means? I have\\r\\nsometimes thought of going to London again after Easter, and sometimes\\r\\nresolved on doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield. Even now, she\\r\\nspeaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June; but June is at\\r\\na great distance, and I believe I shall write to her. I have nearly\\r\\ndetermined on explaining myself by letter. To be at an early certainty\\r\\nis a material object. My present state is miserably irksome. Considering\\r\\neverything, I think a letter will be decidedly the best method of\\r\\nexplanation. I shall be able to write much that I could not say, and\\r\\nshall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her\\r\\nanswer, and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an\\r\\nimmediate hasty impulse; I think I am. My greatest danger would lie in\\r\\nher consulting Mrs. Fraser, and I at a distance unable to help my own\\r\\ncause. A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation, and where\\r\\nthe mind is anything short of perfect decision, an adviser may, in an\\r\\nunlucky moment, lead it to do what it may afterwards regret. I must\\r\\nthink this matter over a little. This long letter, full of my own\\r\\nconcerns alone, will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny.\\r\\nThe last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser's party. I am more\\r\\nand more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him. There is not a\\r\\nshadow of wavering. He thoroughly knows his own mind, and acts up to his\\r\\nresolutions: an inestimable quality. I could not see him and my eldest\\r\\nsister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me,\\r\\nand I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends. There was\\r\\nmarked coolness on her side. They scarcely spoke. I saw him draw back\\r\\nsurprised, and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former\\r\\nsupposed slight to Miss Bertram. You will wish to hear my opinion\\r\\nof Maria's degree of comfort as a wife. There is no appearance of\\r\\nunhappiness. I hope they get on pretty well together. I dined twice in\\r\\nWimpole Street, and might have been there oftener, but it is mortifying\\r\\nto be with Rushworth as a brother. Julia seems to enjoy London\\r\\nexceedingly. I had little enjoyment there, but have less here. We are\\r\\nnot a lively party. You are very much wanted. I miss you more than I\\r\\ncan express. My mother desires her best love, and hopes to hear from\\r\\nyou soon. She talks of you almost every hour, and I am sorry to find\\r\\nhow many weeks more she is likely to be without you. My father means\\r\\nto fetch you himself, but it will not be till after Easter, when he has\\r\\nbusiness in town. You are happy at Portsmouth, I hope, but this must\\r\\nnot be a yearly visit. I want you at home, that I may have your opinion\\r\\nabout Thornton Lacey. I have little heart for extensive improvements\\r\\ntill I know that it will ever have a mistress. I think I shall certainly\\r\\nwrite. It is quite settled that the Grants go to Bath; they leave\\r\\nMansfield on Monday. I am glad of it. I am not comfortable enough to be\\r\\nfit for anybody; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an\\r\\narticle of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.--Yours\\r\\never, my dearest Fanny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a letter again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was\\r\\nFanny's secret declaration as she finished this. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do they bring but\\r\\ndisappointment and sorrow? Not till after Easter! How shall I bear it?\\r\\nAnd my poor aunt talking of me every hour!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could, but\\r\\nshe was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was\\r\\nquite unkind, both to her aunt and to herself. As for the main subject\\r\\nof the letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation. She was\\r\\nalmost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no\\r\\ngood in this delay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said she. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy is not it settled? He is blinded,\\r\\nand nothing will open his eyes; nothing can, after having had truths\\r\\nbefore him so long in vain. He will marry her, and be poor and\\r\\nmiserable. God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be\\r\\nrespectable!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She looked over the letter again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c'So very fond of me!'\\r\\n'tis nonsense all. She loves nobody but herself and her brother. Her\\r\\nfriends leading her astray for years! She is quite as likely to have led\\r\\n_them_ astray. They have all, perhaps, been corrupting one another; but\\r\\nif they are so much fonder of her than she is of them, she is the less\\r\\nlikely to have been hurt, except by their flattery. 'The only woman in\\r\\nthe world whom he could ever think of as a wife.' I firmly believe it.\\r\\nIt is an attachment to govern his whole life. Accepted or refused, his\\r\\nheart is wedded to her for ever. 'The loss of Mary I must consider as\\r\\ncomprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.' Edmund, you do not know\\r\\nme. The families would never be connected if you did not connect\\r\\nthem! Oh! write, write. Finish it at once. Let there be an end of this\\r\\nsuspense. Fix, commit, condemn yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch sensations, however, were too near akin to resentment to be long\\r\\nguiding Fanny's soliloquies. She was soon more softened and sorrowful.\\r\\nHis warm regard, his kind expressions, his confidential treatment,\\r\\ntouched her strongly. He was only too good to everybody. It was a\\r\\nletter, in short, which she would not but have had for the world, and\\r\\nwhich could never be valued enough. This was the end of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody at all addicted to letter-writing, without having much to say,\\r\\nwhich will include a large proportion of the female world at least, must\\r\\nfeel with Lady Bertram that she was out of luck in having such a capital\\r\\npiece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath,\\r\\noccur at a time when she could make no advantage of it, and will admit\\r\\nthat it must have been very mortifying to her to see it fall to the\\r\\nshare of her thankless son, and treated as concisely as possible at the\\r\\nend of a long letter, instead of having it to spread over the largest\\r\\npart of a page of her own. For though Lady Bertram rather shone in the\\r\\nepistolary line, having early in her marriage, from the want of other\\r\\nemployment, and the circumstance of Sir Thomas's being in Parliament,\\r\\ngot into the way of making and keeping correspondents, and formed for\\r\\nherself a very creditable, common-place, amplifying style, so that a\\r\\nvery little matter was enough for her: she could not do entirely without\\r\\nany; she must have something to write about, even to her niece; and\\r\\nbeing so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant's gouty symptoms and\\r\\nMrs. Grant's morning calls, it was very hard upon her to be deprived of\\r\\none of the last epistolary uses she could put them to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a rich amends, however, preparing for her. Lady Bertram's\\r\\nhour of good luck came. Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund's\\r\\nletter, Fanny had one from her aunt, beginning thus--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Dear Fanny,--I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming\\r\\nintelligence, which I make no doubt will give you much concern\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquaint\\r\\nher with all the particulars of the Grants' intended journey, for the\\r\\npresent intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the pen\\r\\nfor many days to come, being no less than the dangerous illness of her\\r\\neldest son, of which they had received notice by express a few hours\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom had gone from London with a party of young men to Newmarket, where\\r\\na neglected fall and a good deal of drinking had brought on a fever; and\\r\\nwhen the party broke up, being unable to move, had been left by himself\\r\\nat the house of one of these young men to the comforts of sickness and\\r\\nsolitude, and the attendance only of servants. Instead of being soon\\r\\nwell enough to follow his friends, as he had then hoped, his disorder\\r\\nincreased considerably, and it was not long before he thought so ill of\\r\\nhimself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched\\r\\nto Mansfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d observed\\r\\nher ladyship, after giving the substance of it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas agitated us\\r\\nexceedingly, and we cannot prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed\\r\\nand apprehensive for the poor invalid, whose state Sir Thomas fears\\r\\nmay be very critical; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother\\r\\nimmediately, but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on\\r\\nthis distressing occasion, as it would be too trying for me. We shall\\r\\ngreatly miss Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope he\\r\\nwill find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be\\r\\napprehended, and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly,\\r\\nwhich Sir Thomas proposes should be done, and thinks best on every\\r\\naccount, and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to\\r\\nbear the removal without material inconvenience or injury. As I\\r\\nhave little doubt of your feeling for us, my dear Fanny, under these\\r\\ndistressing circumstances, I will write again very soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably more warm and\\r\\ngenuine than her aunt's style of writing. She felt truly for them all.\\r\\nTom dangerously ill, Edmund gone to attend him, and the sadly small\\r\\nparty remaining at Mansfield, were cares to shut out every other care,\\r\\nor almost every other. She could just find selfishness enough to wonder\\r\\nwhether Edmund _had_ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came,\\r\\nbut no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate\\r\\nand disinterestedly anxious. Her aunt did not neglect her: she wrote\\r\\nagain and again; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund,\\r\\nand these accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny, in the same\\r\\ndiffuse style, and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears, all\\r\\nfollowing and producing each other at haphazard. It was a sort of\\r\\nplaying at being frightened. The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not\\r\\nsee had little power over her fancy; and she wrote very comfortably\\r\\nabout agitation, and anxiety, and poor invalids, till Tom was actually\\r\\nconveyed to Mansfield, and her own eyes had beheld his altered\\r\\nappearance. Then a letter which she had been previously preparing for\\r\\nFanny was finished in a different style, in the language of real feeling\\r\\nand alarm; then she wrote as she might have spoken. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is just come, my\\r\\ndear Fanny, and is taken upstairs; and I am so shocked to see him, that\\r\\nI do not know what to do. I am sure he has been very ill. Poor Tom! I am\\r\\nquite grieved for him, and very much frightened, and so is Sir Thomas;\\r\\nand how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me. But Sir\\r\\nThomas hopes he will be better to-morrow, and says we must consider his\\r\\njourney.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not\\r\\nsoon over. Tom's extreme impatience to be removed to Mansfield, and\\r\\nexperience those comforts of home and family which had been little\\r\\nthought of in uninterrupted health, had probably induced his being\\r\\nconveyed thither too early, as a return of fever came on, and for a week\\r\\nhe was in a more alarming state than ever. They were all very seriously\\r\\nfrightened. Lady Bertram wrote her daily terrors to her niece, who\\r\\nmight now be said to live upon letters, and pass all her time between\\r\\nsuffering from that of to-day and looking forward to to-morrow's.\\r\\nWithout any particular affection for her eldest cousin, her tenderness\\r\\nof heart made her feel that she could not spare him, and the purity of\\r\\nher principles added yet a keener solicitude, when she considered how\\r\\nlittle useful, how little self-denying his life had (apparently) been.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan was her only companion and listener on this, as on more common\\r\\noccasions. Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise. Nobody else\\r\\ncould be interested in so remote an evil as illness in a family above an\\r\\nhundred miles off; not even Mrs. Price, beyond a brief question or two,\\r\\nif she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand, and now and then the\\r\\nquiet observation of, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of\\r\\ntrouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo long divided and so differently situated, the ties of blood were\\r\\nlittle more than nothing. An attachment, originally as tranquil as their\\r\\ntempers, was now become a mere name. Mrs. Price did quite as much for\\r\\nLady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price. Three or\\r\\nfour Prices might have been swept away, any or all except Fanny and\\r\\nWilliam, and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it; or perhaps\\r\\nmight have caught from Mrs. Norris's lips the cant of its being a very\\r\\nhappy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price to have\\r\\nthem so well provided for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLV\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about the week's end from his return to Mansfield, Tom's immediate\\r\\ndanger was over, and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his mother\\r\\nperfectly easy; for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering,\\r\\nhelpless state, and hearing only the best, and never thinking beyond\\r\\nwhat she heard, with no disposition for alarm and no aptitude at a hint,\\r\\nLady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world for a little medical\\r\\nimposition. The fever was subdued; the fever had been his complaint;\\r\\nof course he would soon be well again. Lady Bertram could think nothing\\r\\nless, and Fanny shared her aunt's security, till she received a few\\r\\nlines from Edmund, written purposely to give her a clearer idea of his\\r\\nbrother's situation, and acquaint her with the apprehensions which\\r\\nhe and his father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some\\r\\nstrong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the frame on the departure\\r\\nof the fever. They judged it best that Lady Bertram should not be\\r\\nharassed by alarms which, it was to be hoped, would prove unfounded;\\r\\nbut there was no reason why Fanny should not know the truth. They were\\r\\napprehensive for his lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom\\r\\nin a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram's sheets of paper\\r\\ncould do. There was hardly any one in the house who might not have\\r\\ndescribed, from personal observation, better than herself; not one who\\r\\nwas not more useful at times to her son. She could do nothing but glide\\r\\nin quietly and look at him; but when able to talk or be talked to, or\\r\\nread to, Edmund was the companion he preferred. His aunt worried him by\\r\\nher cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation or\\r\\nhis voice to the level of irritation and feebleness. Edmund was all in\\r\\nall. Fanny would certainly believe him so at least, and must find that\\r\\nher estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the\\r\\nattendant, supporter, cheerer of a suffering brother. There was not only\\r\\nthe debility of recent illness to assist: there was also, as she now\\r\\nlearnt, nerves much affected, spirits much depressed to calm and raise,\\r\\nand her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly\\r\\nguided.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family were not consumptive, and she was more inclined to hope than\\r\\nfear for her cousin, except when she thought of Miss Crawford; but Miss\\r\\nCrawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck, and to her\\r\\nselfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only\\r\\nson.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten. Edmund's\\r\\nletter had this postscript. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the subject of my last, I had actually\\r\\nbegun a letter when called away by Tom's illness, but I have now changed\\r\\nmy mind, and fear to trust the influence of friends. When Tom is better,\\r\\nI shall go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the state of Mansfield, and so it continued, with scarcely any\\r\\nchange, till Easter. A line occasionally added by Edmund to his\\r\\nmother's letter was enough for Fanny's information. Tom's amendment was\\r\\nalarmingly slow.\\r\\n\\r\\nEaster came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most sorrowfully\\r\\nconsidered, on first learning that she had no chance of leaving\\r\\nPortsmouth till after it. It came, and she had yet heard nothing of her\\r\\nreturn--nothing even of the going to London, which was to precede\\r\\nher return. Her aunt often expressed a wish for her, but there was no\\r\\nnotice, no message from the uncle on whom all depended. She supposed\\r\\nhe could not yet leave his son, but it was a cruel, a terrible delay\\r\\nto her. The end of April was coming on; it would soon be almost three\\r\\nmonths, instead of two, that she had been absent from them all, and that\\r\\nher days had been passing in a state of penance, which she loved them\\r\\ntoo well to hope they would thoroughly understand; and who could yet say\\r\\nwhen there might be leisure to think of or fetch her?\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eagerness, her impatience, her longings to be with them, were such\\r\\nas to bring a line or two of Cowper's Tirocinium for ever before her.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith what intense desire she wants her home,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was continually on her\\r\\ntongue, as the truest description of a yearning which she could not\\r\\nsuppose any schoolboy's bosom to feel more keenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had been coming to Portsmouth, she had loved to call it her\\r\\nhome, had been fond of saying that she was going home; the word had\\r\\nbeen very dear to her, and so it still was, but it must be applied to\\r\\nMansfield. _That_ was now the home. Portsmouth was Portsmouth; Mansfield\\r\\nwas home. They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of her secret\\r\\nmeditations, and nothing was more consolatory to her than to find her\\r\\naunt using the same language: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot but say I much regret your being\\r\\nfrom home at this distressing time, so very trying to my spirits. I\\r\\ntrust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so\\r\\nlong again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were most delightful sentences to her. Still, however, it\\r\\nwas her private regale. Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to\\r\\nbetray such a preference of her uncle's house. It was always: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I go\\r\\nback into Northamptonshire, or when I return to Mansfield, I shall do\\r\\nso and so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For a great while it was so, but at last the longing grew\\r\\nstronger, it overthrew caution, and she found herself talking of what\\r\\nshe should do when she went home before she was aware. She reproached\\r\\nherself, coloured, and looked fearfully towards her father and mother.\\r\\nShe need not have been uneasy. There was no sign of displeasure, or even\\r\\nof hearing her. They were perfectly free from any jealousy of Mansfield.\\r\\nShe was as welcome to wish herself there as to be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring. She had not\\r\\nknown before what pleasures she _had_ to lose in passing March and April\\r\\nin a town. She had not known before how much the beginnings and progress\\r\\nof vegetation had delighted her. What animation, both of body and mind,\\r\\nshe had derived from watching the advance of that season which cannot,\\r\\nin spite of its capriciousness, be unlovely, and seeing its increasing\\r\\nbeauties from the earliest flowers in the warmest divisions of her\\r\\naunt's garden, to the opening of leaves of her uncle's plantations, and\\r\\nthe glory of his woods. To be losing such pleasures was no trifle; to\\r\\nbe losing them, because she was in the midst of closeness and noise,\\r\\nto have confinement, bad air, bad smells, substituted for liberty,\\r\\nfreshness, fragrance, and verdure, was infinitely worse: but even these\\r\\nincitements to regret were feeble, compared with what arose from the\\r\\nconviction of being missed by her best friends, and the longing to be\\r\\nuseful to those who were wanting her!\\r\\n\\r\\nCould she have been at home, she might have been of service to every\\r\\ncreature in the house. She felt that she must have been of use to all.\\r\\nTo all she must have saved some trouble of head or hand; and were it\\r\\nonly in supporting the spirits of her aunt Bertram, keeping her from\\r\\nthe evil of solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless, officious\\r\\ncompanion, too apt to be heightening danger in order to enhance her own\\r\\nimportance, her being there would have been a general good. She loved to\\r\\nfancy how she could have read to her aunt, how she could have talked to\\r\\nher, and tried at once to make her feel the blessing of what was, and\\r\\nprepare her mind for what might be; and how many walks up and down\\r\\nstairs she might have saved her, and how many messages she might have\\r\\ncarried.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt astonished her that Tom's sisters could be satisfied with remaining\\r\\nin London at such a time, through an illness which had now, under\\r\\ndifferent degrees of danger, lasted several weeks. _They_ might return\\r\\nto Mansfield when they chose; travelling could be no difficulty to\\r\\n_them_, and she could not comprehend how both could still keep away.\\r\\nIf Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations, Julia was\\r\\ncertainly able to quit London whenever she chose. It appeared from one\\r\\nof her aunt's letters that Julia had offered to return if wanted, but\\r\\nthis was all. It was evident that she would rather remain where she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was disposed to think the influence of London very much at war\\r\\nwith all respectable attachments. She saw the proof of it in Miss\\r\\nCrawford, as well as in her cousins; _her_ attachment to Edmund had been\\r\\nrespectable, the most respectable part of her character; her friendship\\r\\nfor herself had at least been blameless. Where was either sentiment now?\\r\\nIt was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her, that she had\\r\\nsome reason to think lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelt\\r\\non. It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford or of\\r\\nher other connexions in town, except through Mansfield, and she was\\r\\nbeginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr. Crawford had\\r\\ngone into Norfolk again or not till they met, and might never hear from\\r\\nhis sister any more this spring, when the following letter was received\\r\\nto revive old and create some new sensations--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cForgive me, my dear Fanny, as soon as you can, for my long silence, and\\r\\nbehave as if you could forgive me directly. This is my modest request\\r\\nand expectation, for you are so good, that I depend upon being treated\\r\\nbetter than I deserve, and I write now to beg an immediate answer. I\\r\\nwant to know the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you, no doubt,\\r\\nare perfectly able to give it. One should be a brute not to feel for the\\r\\ndistress they are in; and from what I hear, poor Mr. Bertram has a bad\\r\\nchance of ultimate recovery. I thought little of his illness at first.\\r\\nI looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with, and to\\r\\nmake a fuss himself in any trifling disorder, and was chiefly concerned\\r\\nfor those who had to nurse him; but now it is confidently asserted that\\r\\nhe is really in a decline, that the symptoms are most alarming, and that\\r\\npart of the family, at least, are aware of it. If it be so, I am sure\\r\\nyou must be included in that part, that discerning part, and therefore\\r\\nentreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed. I need\\r\\nnot say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake, but\\r\\nthe report is so prevalent that I confess I cannot help trembling. To\\r\\nhave such a fine young man cut off in the flower of his days is most\\r\\nmelancholy. Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully. I really am quite\\r\\nagitated on the subject. Fanny, Fanny, I see you smile and look cunning,\\r\\nbut, upon my honour, I never bribed a physician in my life. Poor young\\r\\nman! If he is to die, there will be _two_ poor young men less in the\\r\\nworld; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one,\\r\\nthat wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of\\r\\nthem. It was a foolish precipitation last Christmas, but the evil of\\r\\na few days may be blotted out in part. Varnish and gilding hide many\\r\\nstains. It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name. With real\\r\\naffection, Fanny, like mine, more might be overlooked. Write to me by\\r\\nreturn of post, judge of my anxiety, and do not trifle with it. Tell me\\r\\nthe real truth, as you have it from the fountainhead. And now, do\\r\\nnot trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own.\\r\\nBelieve me, they are not only natural, they are philanthropic and\\r\\nvirtuous. I put it to your conscience, whether 'Sir Edmund' would not do\\r\\nmore good with all the Bertram property than any other possible 'Sir.'\\r\\nHad the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you, but you are\\r\\nnow the only one I can apply to for the truth, his sisters not being\\r\\nwithin my reach. Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers\\r\\nat Twickenham (as to be sure you know), and is not yet returned; and\\r\\nJulia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square, but I forget\\r\\ntheir name and street. Could I immediately apply to either, however, I\\r\\nshould still prefer you, because it strikes me that they have all along\\r\\nbeen so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up, as to shut their\\r\\neyes to the truth. I suppose Mrs. R.'s Easter holidays will not last\\r\\nmuch longer; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her. The Aylmers\\r\\nare pleasant people; and her husband away, she can have nothing but\\r\\nenjoyment. I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to\\r\\nBath, to fetch his mother; but how will she and the dowager agree in one\\r\\nhouse? Henry is not at hand, so I have nothing to say from him. Do not\\r\\nyou think Edmund would have been in town again long ago, but for this\\r\\nillness?--Yours ever, Mary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in, but he\\r\\nbrings no intelligence to prevent my sending it. Mrs. R. knows a decline\\r\\nis apprehended; he saw her this morning: she returns to Wimpole Street\\r\\nto-day; the old lady is come. Now do not make yourself uneasy with any\\r\\nqueer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond. He\\r\\ndoes it every spring. Be assured he cares for nobody but you. At this\\r\\nvery moment he is wild to see you, and occupied only in contriving the\\r\\nmeans for doing so, and for making his pleasure conduce to yours. In\\r\\nproof, he repeats, and more eagerly, what he said at Portsmouth about\\r\\nour conveying you home, and I join him in it with all my soul. Dear\\r\\nFanny, write directly, and tell us to come. It will do us all good.\\r\\nHe and I can go to the Parsonage, you know, and be no trouble to our\\r\\nfriends at Mansfield Park. It would really be gratifying to see them\\r\\nall again, and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to\\r\\nthem; and as to yourself, you must feel yourself to be so wanted there,\\r\\nthat you cannot in conscience--conscientious as you are--keep away, when\\r\\nyou have the means of returning. I have not time or patience to give\\r\\nhalf Henry's messages; be satisfied that the spirit of each and every\\r\\none is unalterable affection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny's disgust at the greater part of this letter, with her extreme\\r\\nreluctance to bring the writer of it and her cousin Edmund together,\\r\\nwould have made her (as she felt) incapable of judging impartially\\r\\nwhether the concluding offer might be accepted or not. To herself,\\r\\nindividually, it was most tempting. To be finding herself, perhaps\\r\\nwithin three days, transported to Mansfield, was an image of the\\r\\ngreatest felicity, but it would have been a material drawback to be\\r\\nowing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct, at the\\r\\npresent moment, she saw so much to condemn: the sister's feelings,\\r\\nthe brother's conduct, _her_ cold-hearted ambition, _his_ thoughtless\\r\\nvanity. To have him still the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps, of Mrs.\\r\\nRushworth! She was mortified. She had thought better of him. Happily,\\r\\nhowever, she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite\\r\\ninclinations and doubtful notions of right; there was no occasion to\\r\\ndetermine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not. She\\r\\nhad a rule to apply to, which settled everything. Her awe of her uncle,\\r\\nand her dread of taking a liberty with him, made it instantly plain to\\r\\nher what she had to do. She must absolutely decline the proposal. If he\\r\\nwanted, he would send for her; and even to offer an early return was\\r\\na presumption which hardly anything would have seemed to justify. She\\r\\nthanked Miss Crawford, but gave a decided negative. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer uncle,\\r\\nshe understood, meant to fetch her; and as her cousin's illness had\\r\\ncontinued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary,\\r\\nshe must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present, and that she\\r\\nshould be felt an encumbrance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer representation of her cousin's state at this time was exactly\\r\\naccording to her own belief of it, and such as she supposed would convey\\r\\nto the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything she was\\r\\nwishing for. Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it seemed,\\r\\nunder certain conditions of wealth; and this, she suspected, was all\\r\\nthe conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself\\r\\nupon. She had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but money.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVI\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying a real\\r\\ndisappointment, she was rather in expectation, from her knowledge of\\r\\nMiss Crawford's temper, of being urged again; and though no second\\r\\nletter arrived for the space of a week, she had still the same feeling\\r\\nwhen it did come.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn receiving it, she could instantly decide on its containing little\\r\\nwriting, and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of haste\\r\\nand business. Its object was unquestionable; and two moments were enough\\r\\nto start the probability of its being merely to give her notice that\\r\\nthey should be in Portsmouth that very day, and to throw her into all\\r\\nthe agitation of doubting what she ought to do in such a case. If two\\r\\nmoments, however, can surround with difficulties, a third can disperse\\r\\nthem; and before she had opened the letter, the possibility of Mr. and\\r\\nMiss Crawford's having applied to her uncle and obtained his permission\\r\\nwas giving her ease. This was the letter--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA most scandalous, ill-natured rumour has just reached me, and I write,\\r\\ndear Fanny, to warn you against giving the least credit to it, should it\\r\\nspread into the country. Depend upon it, there is some mistake, and that\\r\\na day or two will clear it up; at any rate, that Henry is blameless, and\\r\\nin spite of a moment's _etourderie_, thinks of nobody but you. Say not a\\r\\nword of it; hear nothing, surmise nothing, whisper nothing till I\\r\\nwrite again. I am sure it will be all hushed up, and nothing proved but\\r\\nRushworth's folly. If they are gone, I would lay my life they are only\\r\\ngone to Mansfield Park, and Julia with them. But why would not you let\\r\\nus come for you? I wish you may not repent it.--Yours, etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny stood aghast. As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour had reached\\r\\nher, it was impossible for her to understand much of this strange\\r\\nletter. She could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Street\\r\\nand Mr. Crawford, and only conjecture that something very imprudent had\\r\\njust occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world, and to\\r\\nexcite her jealousy, in Miss Crawford's apprehension, if she heard it.\\r\\nMiss Crawford need not be alarmed for her. She was only sorry for the\\r\\nparties concerned and for Mansfield, if the report should spread so far;\\r\\nbut she hoped it might not. If the Rushworths were gone themselves to\\r\\nMansfield, as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said, it was\\r\\nnot likely that anything unpleasant should have preceded them, or at\\r\\nleast should make any impression.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to Mr. Crawford, she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own\\r\\ndisposition, convince him that he was not capable of being steadily\\r\\nattached to any one woman in the world, and shame him from persisting\\r\\nany longer in addressing herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very strange! She had begun to think he really loved her, and to\\r\\nfancy his affection for her something more than common; and his sister\\r\\nstill said that he cared for nobody else. Yet there must have been some\\r\\nmarked display of attentions to her cousin, there must have been some\\r\\nstrong indiscretion, since her correspondent was not of a sort to regard\\r\\na slight one.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery uncomfortable she was, and must continue, till she heard from\\r\\nMiss Crawford again. It was impossible to banish the letter from her\\r\\nthoughts, and she could not relieve herself by speaking of it to any\\r\\nhuman being. Miss Crawford need not have urged secrecy with so much\\r\\nwarmth; she might have trusted to her sense of what was due to her\\r\\ncousin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day came and brought no second letter. Fanny was disappointed.\\r\\nShe could still think of little else all the morning; but, when her\\r\\nfather came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual, she\\r\\nwas so far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel that\\r\\nthe subject was for a moment out of her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was deep in other musing. The remembrance of her first evening in\\r\\nthat room, of her father and his newspaper, came across her. No candle\\r\\nwas now wanted. The sun was yet an hour and half above the horizon. She\\r\\nfelt that she had, indeed, been three months there; and the sun's rays\\r\\nfalling strongly into the parlour, instead of cheering, made her still\\r\\nmore melancholy, for sunshine appeared to her a totally different\\r\\nthing in a town and in the country. Here, its power was only a glare:\\r\\na stifling, sickly glare, serving but to bring forward stains and dirt\\r\\nthat might otherwise have slept. There was neither health nor gaiety in\\r\\nsunshine in a town. She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloud\\r\\nof moving dust, and her eyes could only wander from the walls, marked by\\r\\nher father's head, to the table cut and notched by her brothers, where\\r\\nstood the tea-board never thoroughly cleaned, the cups and saucers wiped\\r\\nin streaks, the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin blue, and the\\r\\nbread and butter growing every minute more greasy than even Rebecca's\\r\\nhands had first produced it. Her father read his newspaper, and her\\r\\nmother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual, while the tea was\\r\\nin preparation, and wished Rebecca would mend it; and Fanny was first\\r\\nroused by his calling out to her, after humphing and considering over\\r\\na particular paragraph: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat's the name of your great cousins in town,\\r\\nFan?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment's recollection enabled her to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRushworth, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd don't they live in Wimpole Street?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen, there's the devil to pay among them, that's all! There\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (holding\\r\\nout the paper to her); \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmuch good may such fine relations do you. I\\r\\ndon't know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters; he may be too much\\r\\nof the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less. But,\\r\\nby G--! if she belonged to _me_, I'd give her the rope's end as long as\\r\\nI could stand over her. A little flogging for man and woman too would be\\r\\nthe best way of preventing such things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny read to herself that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was with infinite concern the newspaper\\r\\nhad to announce to the world a matrimonial _fracas_ in the family of\\r\\nMr. R. of Wimpole Street; the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not long\\r\\nbeen enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised to become\\r\\nso brilliant a leader in the fashionable world, having quitted her\\r\\nhusband's roof in company with the well-known and captivating Mr. C.,\\r\\nthe intimate friend and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known even\\r\\nto the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a mistake, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny instantly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit must be a mistake, it\\r\\ncannot be true; it must mean some other people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame; she spoke with\\r\\na resolution which sprung from despair, for she spoke what she did not,\\r\\ncould not believe herself. It had been the shock of conviction as she\\r\\nread. The truth rushed on her; and how she could have spoken at all,\\r\\nhow she could even have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder to\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Price cared too little about the report to make her much answer.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt might be all a lie,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he acknowledged; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut so many fine ladies were\\r\\ngoing to the devil nowadays that way, that there was no answering for\\r\\nanybody.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I hope it is not true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Price plaintively; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit would\\r\\nbe so very shocking! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet,\\r\\nI am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times; have not I, Betsey? And\\r\\nit would not be ten minutes' work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe horror of a mind like Fanny's, as it received the conviction of such\\r\\nguilt, and began to take in some part of the misery that must ensue, can\\r\\nhardly be described. At first, it was a sort of stupefaction; but every\\r\\nmoment was quickening her perception of the horrible evil. She could not\\r\\ndoubt, she dared not indulge a hope, of the paragraph being false. Miss\\r\\nCrawford's letter, which she had read so often as to make every line\\r\\nher own, was in frightful conformity with it. Her eager defence of her\\r\\nbrother, her hope of its being _hushed_ _up_, her evident agitation,\\r\\nwere all of a piece with something very bad; and if there was a woman\\r\\nof character in existence, who could treat as a trifle this sin of the\\r\\nfirst magnitude, who would try to gloss it over, and desire to have it\\r\\nunpunished, she could believe Miss Crawford to be the woman! Now she\\r\\ncould see her own mistake as to _who_ were gone, or _said_ to be\\r\\ngone. It was not Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth; it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr.\\r\\nCrawford.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before. There was no\\r\\npossibility of rest. The evening passed without a pause of misery, the\\r\\nnight was totally sleepless. She passed only from feelings of sickness\\r\\nto shudderings of horror; and from hot fits of fever to cold. The event\\r\\nwas so shocking, that there were moments even when her heart revolted\\r\\nfrom it as impossible: when she thought it could not be. A woman married\\r\\nonly six months ago; a man professing himself devoted, even _engaged_ to\\r\\nanother; that other her near relation; the whole family, both families\\r\\nconnected as they were by tie upon tie; all friends, all intimate\\r\\ntogether! It was too horrible a confusion of guilt, too gross a\\r\\ncomplication of evil, for human nature, not in a state of utter\\r\\nbarbarism, to be capable of! yet her judgment told her it was so.\\r\\n_His_ unsettled affections, wavering with his vanity, _Maria's_\\r\\ndecided attachment, and no sufficient principle on either side, gave it\\r\\npossibility: Miss Crawford's letter stampt it a fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would be the consequence? Whom would it not injure? Whose views\\r\\nmight it not affect? Whose peace would it not cut up for ever? Miss\\r\\nCrawford, herself, Edmund; but it was dangerous, perhaps, to tread\\r\\nsuch ground. She confined herself, or tried to confine herself, to the\\r\\nsimple, indubitable family misery which must envelop all, if it were\\r\\nindeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure. The mother's\\r\\nsufferings, the father's; there she paused. Julia's, Tom's, Edmund's;\\r\\nthere a yet longer pause. They were the two on whom it would fall most\\r\\nhorribly. Sir Thomas's parental solicitude and high sense of honour and\\r\\ndecorum, Edmund's upright principles, unsuspicious temper, and genuine\\r\\nstrength of feeling, made her think it scarcely possible for them to\\r\\nsupport life and reason under such disgrace; and it appeared to her\\r\\nthat, as far as this world alone was concerned, the greatest blessing to\\r\\nevery one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be instant annihilation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing happened the next day, or the next, to weaken her terrors. Two\\r\\nposts came in, and brought no refutation, public or private. There was\\r\\nno second letter to explain away the first from Miss Crawford; there was\\r\\nno intelligence from Mansfield, though it was now full time for her\\r\\nto hear again from her aunt. This was an evil omen. She had, indeed,\\r\\nscarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe her mind, and was reduced to so\\r\\nlow and wan and trembling a condition, as no mother, not unkind, except\\r\\nMrs. Price could have overlooked, when the third day did bring the\\r\\nsickening knock, and a letter was again put into her hands. It bore the\\r\\nLondon postmark, and came from Edmund.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Fanny,--You know our present wretchedness. May God support you\\r\\nunder your share! We have been here two days, but there is nothing to\\r\\nbe done. They cannot be traced. You may not have heard of the last\\r\\nblow--Julia's elopement; she is gone to Scotland with Yates. She left\\r\\nLondon a few hours before we entered it. At any other time this would\\r\\nhave been felt dreadfully. Now it seems nothing; yet it is an heavy\\r\\naggravation. My father is not overpowered. More cannot be hoped. He is\\r\\nstill able to think and act; and I write, by his desire, to propose your\\r\\nreturning home. He is anxious to get you there for my mother's sake. I\\r\\nshall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this, and hope to\\r\\nfind you ready to set off for Mansfield. My father wishes you to invite\\r\\nSusan to go with you for a few months. Settle it as you like; say what\\r\\nis proper; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his kindness at\\r\\nsuch a moment! Do justice to his meaning, however I may confuse it. You\\r\\nmay imagine something of my present state. There is no end of the evil\\r\\nlet loose upon us. You will see me early by the mail.--Yours, etc.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNever had Fanny more wanted a cordial. Never had she felt such a one\\r\\nas this letter contained. To-morrow! to leave Portsmouth to-morrow!\\r\\nShe was, she felt she was, in the greatest danger of being exquisitely\\r\\nhappy, while so many were miserable. The evil which brought such good\\r\\nto her! She dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it. To be\\r\\ngoing so soon, sent for so kindly, sent for as a comfort, and with leave\\r\\nto take Susan, was altogether such a combination of blessings as set her\\r\\nheart in a glow, and for a time seemed to distance every pain, and\\r\\nmake her incapable of suitably sharing the distress even of those\\r\\nwhose distress she thought of most. Julia's elopement could affect her\\r\\ncomparatively but little; she was amazed and shocked; but it could not\\r\\noccupy her, could not dwell on her mind. She was obliged to call herself\\r\\nto think of it, and acknowledge it to be terrible and grievous, or it\\r\\nwas escaping her, in the midst of all the agitating pressing joyful\\r\\ncares attending this summons to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing like employment, active indispensable employment, for\\r\\nrelieving sorrow. Employment, even melancholy, may dispel melancholy,\\r\\nand her occupations were hopeful. She had so much to do, that not even\\r\\nthe horrible story of Mrs. Rushworth--now fixed to the last point of\\r\\ncertainty could affect her as it had done before. She had not time to\\r\\nbe miserable. Within twenty-four hours she was hoping to be gone; her\\r\\nfather and mother must be spoken to, Susan prepared, everything got\\r\\nready. Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough. The\\r\\nhappiness she was imparting, too, happiness very little alloyed by the\\r\\nblack communication which must briefly precede it--the joyful consent\\r\\nof her father and mother to Susan's going with her--the general\\r\\nsatisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded, and the\\r\\necstasy of Susan herself, was all serving to support her spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe affliction of the Bertrams was little felt in the family. Mrs. Price\\r\\ntalked of her poor sister for a few minutes, but how to find anything to\\r\\nhold Susan's clothes, because Rebecca took away all the boxes and spoilt\\r\\nthem, was much more in her thoughts: and as for Susan, now unexpectedly\\r\\ngratified in the first wish of her heart, and knowing nothing personally\\r\\nof those who had sinned, or of those who were sorrowing--if she could\\r\\nhelp rejoicing from beginning to end, it was as much as ought to be\\r\\nexpected from human virtue at fourteen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price, or the good\\r\\noffices of Rebecca, everything was rationally and duly accomplished,\\r\\nand the girls were ready for the morrow. The advantage of much sleep\\r\\nto prepare them for their journey was impossible. The cousin who was\\r\\ntravelling towards them could hardly have less than visited their\\r\\nagitated spirits--one all happiness, the other all varying and\\r\\nindescribable perturbation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy eight in the morning Edmund was in the house. The girls heard his\\r\\nentrance from above, and Fanny went down. The idea of immediately seeing\\r\\nhim, with the knowledge of what he must be suffering, brought back all\\r\\nher own first feelings. He so near her, and in misery. She was ready to\\r\\nsink as she entered the parlour. He was alone, and met her instantly;\\r\\nand she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words, just\\r\\narticulate, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort now!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She could\\r\\nsay nothing; nor for some minutes could he say more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned away to recover himself, and when he spoke again, though his\\r\\nvoice still faltered, his manner shewed the wish of self-command, and\\r\\nthe resolution of avoiding any farther allusion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you breakfasted?\\r\\nWhen shall you be ready? Does Susan go?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were questions following each\\r\\nother rapidly. His great object was to be off as soon as possible. When\\r\\nMansfield was considered, time was precious; and the state of his own\\r\\nmind made him find relief only in motion. It was settled that he should\\r\\norder the carriage to the door in half an hour. Fanny answered for their\\r\\nhaving breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour. He had already\\r\\nate, and declined staying for their meal. He would walk round the\\r\\nramparts, and join them with the carriage. He was gone again; glad to\\r\\nget away even from Fanny.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked very ill; evidently suffering under violent emotions, which he\\r\\nwas determined to suppress. She knew it must be so, but it was terrible\\r\\nto her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carriage came; and he entered the house again at the same\\r\\nmoment, just in time to spend a few minutes with the family, and be a\\r\\nwitness--but that he saw nothing--of the tranquil manner in which the\\r\\ndaughters were parted with, and just in time to prevent their sitting\\r\\ndown to the breakfast-table, which, by dint of much unusual activity,\\r\\nwas quite and completely ready as the carriage drove from the door.\\r\\nFanny's last meal in her father's house was in character with her first:\\r\\nshe was dismissed from it as hospitably as she had been welcomed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she passed the barriers\\r\\nof Portsmouth, and how Susan's face wore its broadest smiles, may be\\r\\neasily conceived. Sitting forwards, however, and screened by her bonnet,\\r\\nthose smiles were unseen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey was likely to be a silent one. Edmund's deep sighs often\\r\\nreached Fanny. Had he been alone with her, his heart must have opened\\r\\nin spite of every resolution; but Susan's presence drove him quite into\\r\\nhimself, and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be\\r\\nlong supported.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny watched him with never-failing solicitude, and sometimes catching\\r\\nhis eye, revived an affectionate smile, which comforted her; but the\\r\\nfirst day's journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the\\r\\nsubjects that were weighing him down. The next morning produced a\\r\\nlittle more. Just before their setting out from Oxford, while Susan was\\r\\nstationed at a window, in eager observation of the departure of a\\r\\nlarge family from the inn, the other two were standing by the fire; and\\r\\nEdmund, particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny's looks, and from\\r\\nhis ignorance of the daily evils of her father's house, attributing an\\r\\nundue share of the change, attributing _all_ to the recent event, took\\r\\nher hand, and said in a low, but very expressive tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo wonder--you\\r\\nmust feel it--you must suffer. How a man who had once loved, could\\r\\ndesert you! But _yours_--your regard was new compared with----Fanny,\\r\\nthink of _me_!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first division of their journey occupied a long day, and brought\\r\\nthem, almost knocked up, to Oxford; but the second was over at a much\\r\\nearlier hour. They were in the environs of Mansfield long before the\\r\\nusual dinner-time, and as they approached the beloved place, the hearts\\r\\nof both sisters sank a little. Fanny began to dread the meeting with her\\r\\naunts and Tom, under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feel\\r\\nwith some anxiety, that all her best manners, all her lately acquired\\r\\nknowledge of what was practised here, was on the point of being called\\r\\ninto action. Visions of good and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and new\\r\\ngentilities, were before her; and she was meditating much upon silver\\r\\nforks, napkins, and finger-glasses. Fanny had been everywhere awake to\\r\\nthe difference of the country since February; but when they entered the\\r\\nPark her perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest sort. It was\\r\\nthree months, full three months, since her quitting it, and the\\r\\nchange was from winter to summer. Her eye fell everywhere on lawns\\r\\nand plantations of the freshest green; and the trees, though not fully\\r\\nclothed, were in that delightful state when farther beauty is known to\\r\\nbe at hand, and when, while much is actually given to the sight, more\\r\\nyet remains for the imagination. Her enjoyment, however, was for herself\\r\\nalone. Edmund could not share it. She looked at him, but he was leaning\\r\\nback, sunk in a deeper gloom than ever, and with eyes closed, as if the\\r\\nview of cheerfulness oppressed him, and the lovely scenes of home must\\r\\nbe shut out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt made her melancholy again; and the knowledge of what must be enduring\\r\\nthere, invested even the house, modern, airy, and well situated as it\\r\\nwas, with a melancholy aspect.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy one of the suffering party within they were expected with such\\r\\nimpatience as she had never known before. Fanny had scarcely passed the\\r\\nsolemn-looking servants, when Lady Bertram came from the drawing-room\\r\\nto meet her; came with no indolent step; and falling on her neck, said,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Fanny! now I shall be comfortable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVII\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been a miserable party, each of the three believing themselves\\r\\nmost miserable. Mrs. Norris, however, as most attached to Maria, was\\r\\nreally the greatest sufferer. Maria was her first favourite, the dearest\\r\\nof all; the match had been her own contriving, as she had been wont with\\r\\nsuch pride of heart to feel and say, and this conclusion of it almost\\r\\noverpowered her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an altered creature, quieted, stupefied, indifferent to\\r\\neverything that passed. The being left with her sister and nephew, and\\r\\nall the house under her care, had been an advantage entirely thrown\\r\\naway; she had been unable to direct or dictate, or even fancy herself\\r\\nuseful. When really touched by affliction, her active powers had been\\r\\nall benumbed; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her the\\r\\nsmallest support or attempt at support. She had done no more for them\\r\\nthan they had done for each other. They had been all solitary, helpless,\\r\\nand forlorn alike; and now the arrival of the others only established\\r\\nher superiority in wretchedness. Her companions were relieved, but there\\r\\nwas no good for _her_. Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother\\r\\nas Fanny to her aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having comfort from\\r\\neither, was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom, in\\r\\nthe blindness of her anger, she could have charged as the daemon of the\\r\\npiece. Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSusan too was a grievance. She had not spirits to notice her in more\\r\\nthan a few repulsive looks, but she felt her as a spy, and an intruder,\\r\\nand an indigent niece, and everything most odious. By her other aunt,\\r\\nSusan was received with quiet kindness. Lady Bertram could not give her\\r\\nmuch time, or many words, but she felt her, as Fanny's sister, to have\\r\\na claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan\\r\\nwas more than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing but\\r\\nill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided\\r\\nwith happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape from\\r\\nmany certain evils, that she could have stood against a great deal more\\r\\nindifference than she met with from the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted with the\\r\\nhouse and grounds as she could, and spent her days very happily in so\\r\\ndoing, while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut\\r\\nup, or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them, at\\r\\nthis time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying to bury his own\\r\\nfeelings in exertions for the relief of his brother's, and Fanny devoted\\r\\nto her aunt Bertram, returning to every former office with more than\\r\\nformer zeal, and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed\\r\\nso much to want her.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo talk over the dreadful business with Fanny, talk and lament, was all\\r\\nLady Bertram's consolation. To be listened to and borne with, and hear\\r\\nthe voice of kindness and sympathy in return, was everything that could\\r\\nbe done for her. To be otherwise comforted was out of the question. The\\r\\ncase admitted of no comfort. Lady Bertram did not think deeply, but,\\r\\nguided by Sir Thomas, she thought justly on all important points; and\\r\\nshe saw, therefore, in all its enormity, what had happened, and neither\\r\\nendeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her, to think little\\r\\nof guilt and infamy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer affections were not acute, nor was her mind tenacious. After a time,\\r\\nFanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects,\\r\\nand revive some interest in the usual occupations; but whenever Lady\\r\\nBertram _was_ fixed on the event, she could see it only in one light, as\\r\\ncomprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace never to be wiped\\r\\noff.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired. Her\\r\\naunt was no very methodical narrator, but with the help of some letters\\r\\nto and from Sir Thomas, and what she already knew herself, and could\\r\\nreasonably combine, she was soon able to understand quite as much as she\\r\\nwished of the circumstances attending the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays, to Twickenham, with\\r\\na family whom she had just grown intimate with: a family of lively,\\r\\nagreeable manners, and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for to\\r\\n_their_ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times. His having\\r\\nbeen in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew. Mr. Rushworth had\\r\\nbeen gone at this time to Bath, to pass a few days with his mother, and\\r\\nbring her back to town, and Maria was with these friends without any\\r\\nrestraint, without even Julia; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street\\r\\ntwo or three weeks before, on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas;\\r\\na removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute\\r\\nto some view of convenience on Mr. Yates's account. Very soon after the\\r\\nRushworths' return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received a letter\\r\\nfrom an old and most particular friend in London, who hearing and\\r\\nwitnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter, wrote to recommend\\r\\nSir Thomas's coming to London himself, and using his influence with his\\r\\ndaughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to\\r\\nunpleasant remarks, and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter, without communicating\\r\\nits contents to any creature at Mansfield, when it was followed by\\r\\nanother, sent express from the same friend, to break to him the almost\\r\\ndesperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people.\\r\\nMrs. Rushworth had left her husband's house: Mr. Rushworth had been\\r\\nin great anger and distress to _him_ (Mr. Harding) for his advice; Mr.\\r\\nHarding feared there had been _at_ _least_ very flagrant indiscretion.\\r\\nThe maidservant of Mrs. Rushworth, senior, threatened alarmingly. He\\r\\nwas doing all in his power to quiet everything, with the hope of Mrs.\\r\\nRushworth's return, but was so much counteracted in Wimpole Street by\\r\\nthe influence of Mr. Rushworth's mother, that the worst consequences\\r\\nmight be apprehended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest of the\\r\\nfamily. Sir Thomas set off, Edmund would go with him, and the others had\\r\\nbeen left in a state of wretchedness, inferior only to what followed\\r\\nthe receipt of the next letters from London. Everything was by that time\\r\\npublic beyond a hope. The servant of Mrs. Rushworth, the mother, had\\r\\nexposure in her power, and supported by her mistress, was not to be\\r\\nsilenced. The two ladies, even in the short time they had been\\r\\ntogether, had disagreed; and the bitterness of the elder against her\\r\\ndaughter-in-law might perhaps arise almost as much from the personal\\r\\ndisrespect with which she had herself been treated as from sensibility\\r\\nfor her son.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever that might be, she was unmanageable. But had she been less\\r\\nobstinate, or of less weight with her son, who was always guided by the\\r\\nlast speaker, by the person who could get hold of and shut him up, the\\r\\ncase would still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear\\r\\nagain, and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed\\r\\nsomewhere with Mr. Crawford, who had quitted his uncle's house, as for a\\r\\njourney, on the very day of her absenting herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas, however, remained yet a little longer in town, in the hope\\r\\nof discovering and snatching her from farther vice, though all was lost\\r\\non the side of character.\\r\\n\\r\\n_His_ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of. There was but\\r\\none of his children who was not at this time a source of misery to\\r\\nhim. Tom's complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his\\r\\nsister's conduct, and his recovery so much thrown back by it, that even\\r\\nLady Bertram had been struck by the difference, and all her alarms were\\r\\nregularly sent off to her husband; and Julia's elopement, the additional\\r\\nblow which had met him on his arrival in London, though its force had\\r\\nbeen deadened at the moment, must, she knew, be sorely felt. She saw\\r\\nthat it was. His letters expressed how much he deplored it. Under any\\r\\ncircumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance; but to have it\\r\\nso clandestinely formed, and such a period chosen for its completion,\\r\\nplaced Julia's feelings in a most unfavourable light, and severely\\r\\naggravated the folly of her choice. He called it a bad thing, done in\\r\\nthe worst manner, and at the worst time; and though Julia was yet as\\r\\nmore pardonable than Maria as folly than vice, he could not but\\r\\nregard the step she had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a\\r\\nconclusion hereafter like her sister's. Such was his opinion of the set\\r\\ninto which she had thrown herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny felt for him most acutely. He could have no comfort but in Edmund.\\r\\nEvery other child must be racking his heart. His displeasure against\\r\\nherself she trusted, reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris, would now\\r\\nbe done away. _She_ should be justified. Mr. Crawford would have fully\\r\\nacquitted her conduct in refusing him; but this, though most material\\r\\nto herself, would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas. Her uncle's\\r\\ndispleasure was terrible to her; but what could her justification or her\\r\\ngratitude and attachment do for him? His stay must be on Edmund alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was mistaken, however, in supposing that Edmund gave his father no\\r\\npresent pain. It was of a much less poignant nature than what the others\\r\\nexcited; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very deeply\\r\\ninvolved in the offence of his sister and friend; cut off by it, as\\r\\nhe must be, from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubted\\r\\nattachment and strong probability of success; and who, in everything but\\r\\nthis despicable brother, would have been so eligible a connexion. He was\\r\\naware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf, in addition\\r\\nto all the rest, when they were in town: he had seen or conjectured\\r\\nhis feelings; and, having reason to think that one interview with Miss\\r\\nCrawford had taken place, from which Edmund derived only increased\\r\\ndistress, had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him\\r\\nout of town, and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt, with\\r\\na view to his relief and benefit, no less than theirs. Fanny was not in\\r\\nthe secret of her uncle's feelings, Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss\\r\\nCrawford's character. Had he been privy to her conversation with his\\r\\nson, he would not have wished her to belong to him, though her twenty\\r\\nthousand pounds had been forty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit\\r\\nof a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she knew that he felt the same, her\\r\\nown conviction was insufficient. She thought he did, but she wanted to\\r\\nbe assured of it. If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which\\r\\nhad sometimes been too much for her before, it would be most consoling;\\r\\nbut _that_ she found was not to be. She seldom saw him: never alone. He\\r\\nprobably avoided being alone with her. What was to be inferred? That\\r\\nhis judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share of this\\r\\nfamily affliction, but that it was too keenly felt to be a subject of\\r\\nthe slightest communication. This must be his state. He yielded, but it\\r\\nwas with agonies which did not admit of speech. Long, long would it be\\r\\nere Miss Crawford's name passed his lips again, or she could hope for a\\r\\nrenewal of such confidential intercourse as had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt _was_ long. They reached Mansfield on Thursday, and it was not till\\r\\nSunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject. Sitting\\r\\nwith her on Sunday evening--a wet Sunday evening--the very time of\\r\\nall others when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must be opened, and\\r\\neverything told; no one else in the room, except his mother, who,\\r\\nafter hearing an affecting sermon, had cried herself to sleep, it was\\r\\nimpossible not to speak; and so, with the usual beginnings, hardly to\\r\\nbe traced as to what came first, and the usual declaration that if she\\r\\nwould listen to him for a few minutes, he should be very brief, and\\r\\ncertainly never tax her kindness in the same way again; she need not\\r\\nfear a repetition; it would be a subject prohibited entirely: he entered\\r\\nupon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first\\r\\ninterest to himself, to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quite\\r\\nconvinced.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Fanny listened, with what curiosity and concern, what pain and what\\r\\ndelight, how the agitation of his voice was watched, and how carefully\\r\\nher own eyes were fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined. The\\r\\nopening was alarming. He had seen Miss Crawford. He had been invited to\\r\\nsee her. He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call;\\r\\nand regarding it as what was meant to be the last, last interview\\r\\nof friendship, and investing her with all the feelings of shame and\\r\\nwretchedness which Crawford's sister ought to have known, he had gone to\\r\\nher in such a state of mind, so softened, so devoted, as made it for a\\r\\nfew moments impossible to Fanny's fears that it should be the last. But\\r\\nas he proceeded in his story, these fears were over. She had met him,\\r\\nhe said, with a serious--certainly a serious--even an agitated air;\\r\\nbut before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence, she had\\r\\nintroduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c'I\\r\\nheard you were in town,' said she; 'I wanted to see you. Let us talk\\r\\nover this sad business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?'\\r\\nI could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She felt reproved.\\r\\nSometimes how quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she then\\r\\nadded, 'I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister's expense.' So\\r\\nshe began, but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to be\\r\\nrepeated to you. I cannot recall all her words. I would not dwell upon\\r\\nthem if I could. Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of each.\\r\\nShe reprobated her brother's folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he\\r\\nhad never cared for, to do what must lose him the woman he adored; but\\r\\nstill more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a situation,\\r\\nplunging into such difficulties, under the idea of being really loved\\r\\nby a man who had long ago made his indifference clear. Guess what I must\\r\\nhave felt. To hear the woman whom--no harsher name than folly given!\\r\\nSo voluntarily, so freely, so coolly to canvass it! No reluctance, no\\r\\nhorror, no feminine, shall I say, no modest loathings? This is what the\\r\\nworld does. For where, Fanny, shall we find a woman whom nature had so\\r\\nrichly endowed? Spoilt, spoilt!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a little reflection, he went on with a sort of desperate calmness.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will tell you everything, and then have done for ever. She saw it\\r\\nonly as folly, and that folly stamped only by exposure. The want of\\r\\ncommon discretion, of caution: his going down to Richmond for the whole\\r\\ntime of her being at Twickenham; her putting herself in the power of\\r\\na servant; it was the detection, in short--oh, Fanny! it was the\\r\\ndetection, not the offence, which she reprobated. It was the imprudence\\r\\nwhich had brought things to extremity, and obliged her brother to give\\r\\nup every dearer plan in order to fly with her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopt. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny (believing herself required to speak),\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat could you say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing, nothing to be understood. I was like a man stunned. She\\r\\nwent on, began to talk of you; yes, then she began to talk of you,\\r\\nregretting, as well she might, the loss of such a--. There she spoke\\r\\nvery rationally. But she has always done justice to you. 'He has thrown\\r\\naway,' said she, 'such a woman as he will never see again. She would\\r\\nhave fixed him; she would have made him happy for ever.' My dearest\\r\\nFanny, I am giving you, I hope, more pleasure than pain by this\\r\\nretrospect of what might have been--but what never can be now. You do\\r\\nnot wish me to be silent? If you do, give me but a look, a word, and I\\r\\nhave done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNo look or word was given.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank God,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were all disposed to wonder, but it seems to\\r\\nhave been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which\\r\\nknew no guile should not suffer. She spoke of you with high praise and\\r\\nwarm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash of evil; for in\\r\\nthe midst of it she could exclaim, 'Why would not she have him? It is\\r\\nall her fault. Simple girl! I shall never forgive her. Had she accepted\\r\\nhim as she ought, they might now have been on the point of marriage, and\\r\\nHenry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object.\\r\\nHe would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again.\\r\\nIt would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation, in yearly\\r\\nmeetings at Sotherton and Everingham.' Could you have believed it\\r\\npossible? But the charm is broken. My eyes are opened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCruel!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fanny, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquite cruel. At such a moment to give way to\\r\\ngaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you! Absolute cruelty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCruelty, do you call it? We differ there. No, hers is not a cruel\\r\\nnature. I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings. The evil\\r\\nlies yet deeper: in her total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there being\\r\\nsuch feelings; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to\\r\\ntreat the subject as she did. She was speaking only as she had been used\\r\\nto hear others speak, as she imagined everybody else would speak. Hers\\r\\nare not faults of temper. She would not voluntarily give unnecessary\\r\\npain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot but think\\r\\nthat for me, for my feelings, she would--Hers are faults of principle,\\r\\nFanny; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind. Perhaps it\\r\\nis best for me, since it leaves me so little to regret. Not so, however.\\r\\nGladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her, rather\\r\\nthan have to think of her as I do. I told her so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; when I left her I told her so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow long were you together?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFive-and-twenty minutes. Well, she went on to say that what remained\\r\\nnow to be done was to bring about a marriage between them. She spoke of\\r\\nit, Fanny, with a steadier voice than I can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He was obliged to pause\\r\\nmore than once as he continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c'We must persuade Henry to marry\\r\\nher,' said she; 'and what with honour, and the certainty of having shut\\r\\nhimself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair of it. Fanny he must\\r\\ngive up. I do not think that even _he_ could now hope to succeed with\\r\\none of her stamp, and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable\\r\\ndifficulty. My influence, which is not small shall all go that way; and\\r\\nwhen once married, and properly supported by her own family, people of\\r\\nrespectability as they are, she may recover her footing in society to a\\r\\ncertain degree. In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted,\\r\\nbut with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be those\\r\\nwho will be glad of her acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more\\r\\nliberality and candour on those points than formerly. What I advise\\r\\nis, that your father be quiet. Do not let him injure his own cause by\\r\\ninterference. Persuade him to let things take their course. If by any\\r\\nofficious exertions of his, she is induced to leave Henry's protection,\\r\\nthere will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain\\r\\nwith him. I know how he is likely to be influenced. Let Sir Thomas trust\\r\\nto his honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he get his\\r\\ndaughter away, it will be destroying the chief hold.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watching\\r\\nhim with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that the\\r\\nsubject had been entered on at all. It was long before he could speak\\r\\nagain. At last, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Fanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall soon have done. I have\\r\\ntold you the substance of all that she said. As soon as I could speak,\\r\\nI replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state of\\r\\nmind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to make\\r\\nme suffer more, but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost\\r\\nevery sentence. That though I had, in the course of our acquaintance,\\r\\nbeen often sensible of some difference in our opinions, on points,\\r\\ntoo, of some moment, it had not entered my imagination to conceive the\\r\\ndifference could be such as she had now proved it. That the manner in\\r\\nwhich she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my\\r\\nsister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say),\\r\\nbut the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself, giving it every\\r\\nreproach but the right; considering its ill consequences only as they\\r\\nwere to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in\\r\\nwrong; and last of all, and above all, recommending to us a compliance,\\r\\na compromise, an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin, on the\\r\\nchance of a marriage which, thinking as I now thought of her brother,\\r\\nshould rather be prevented than sought; all this together most\\r\\ngrievously convinced me that I had never understood her before, and\\r\\nthat, as far as related to mind, it had been the creature of my own\\r\\nimagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been too apt to dwell on\\r\\nfor many months past. That, perhaps, it was best for me; I had less to\\r\\nregret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings, hopes which must, at any\\r\\nrate, have been torn from me now. And yet, that I must and would confess\\r\\nthat, could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before,\\r\\nI would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting, for the\\r\\nsake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem. This is\\r\\nwhat I said, the purport of it; but, as you may imagine, not spoken\\r\\nso collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you. She was\\r\\nastonished, exceedingly astonished--more than astonished. I saw her\\r\\nchange countenance. She turned extremely red. I imagined I saw a\\r\\nmixture of many feelings: a great, though short struggle; half a wish of\\r\\nyielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but habit, habit carried\\r\\nit. She would have laughed if she could. It was a sort of laugh, as she\\r\\nanswered, 'A pretty good lecture, upon my word. Was it part of your last\\r\\nsermon? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and\\r\\nThornton Lacey; and when I hear of you next, it may be as a celebrated\\r\\npreacher in some great society of Methodists, or as a missionary into\\r\\nforeign parts.' She tried to speak carelessly, but she was not so\\r\\ncareless as she wanted to appear. I only said in reply, that from my\\r\\nheart I wished her well, and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn\\r\\nto think more justly, and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could\\r\\nany of us acquire, the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty, to the\\r\\nlessons of affliction, and immediately left the room. I had gone a few\\r\\nsteps, Fanny, when I heard the door open behind me. 'Mr. Bertram,' said\\r\\nshe. I looked back. 'Mr. Bertram,' said she, with a smile; but it was\\r\\na smile ill-suited to the conversation that had passed, a saucy playful\\r\\nsmile, seeming to invite in order to subdue me; at least it appeared so\\r\\nto me. I resisted; it was the impulse of the moment to resist, and still\\r\\nwalked on. I have since, sometimes, for a moment, regretted that I did\\r\\nnot go back, but I know I was right, and such has been the end of our\\r\\nacquaintance. And what an acquaintance has it been! How have I been\\r\\ndeceived! Equally in brother and sister deceived! I thank you for your\\r\\npatience, Fanny. This has been the greatest relief, and now we will have\\r\\ndone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd such was Fanny's dependence on his words, that for five minutes\\r\\nshe thought they _had_ done. Then, however, it all came on again, or\\r\\nsomething very like it, and nothing less than Lady Bertram's rousing\\r\\nthoroughly up could really close such a conversation. Till that\\r\\nhappened, they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she had\\r\\nattached him, and how delightful nature had made her, and how excellent\\r\\nshe would have been, had she fallen into good hands earlier. Fanny, now\\r\\nat liberty to speak openly, felt more than justified in adding to\\r\\nhis knowledge of her real character, by some hint of what share his\\r\\nbrother's state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a\\r\\ncomplete reconciliation. This was not an agreeable intimation. Nature\\r\\nresisted it for a while. It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to\\r\\nhave had her more disinterested in her attachment; but his vanity was\\r\\nnot of a strength to fight long against reason. He submitted to believe\\r\\nthat Tom's illness had influenced her, only reserving for himself this\\r\\nconsoling thought, that considering the many counteractions of opposing\\r\\nhabits, she had certainly been _more_ attached to him than could have\\r\\nbeen expected, and for his sake been more near doing right. Fanny\\r\\nthought exactly the same; and they were also quite agreed in their\\r\\nopinion of the lasting effect, the indelible impression, which such\\r\\na disappointment must make on his mind. Time would undoubtedly abate\\r\\nsomewhat of his sufferings, but still it was a sort of thing which he\\r\\nnever could get entirely the better of; and as to his ever meeting with\\r\\nany other woman who could--it was too impossible to be named but with\\r\\nindignation. Fanny's friendship was all that he had to cling to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nLet other pens dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects\\r\\nas soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault\\r\\nthemselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with all the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Fanny, indeed, at this very time, I have the satisfaction of knowing,\\r\\nmust have been happy in spite of everything. She must have been a happy\\r\\ncreature in spite of all that she felt, or thought she felt, for the\\r\\ndistress of those around her. She had sources of delight that must force\\r\\ntheir way. She was returned to Mansfield Park, she was useful, she was\\r\\nbeloved; she was safe from Mr. Crawford; and when Sir Thomas came back\\r\\nshe had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of\\r\\nspirits, of his perfect approbation and increased regard; and happy as\\r\\nall this must make her, she would still have been happy without any of\\r\\nit, for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself. He was suffering\\r\\nfrom disappointment and regret, grieving over what was, and wishing for\\r\\nwhat could never be. She knew it was so, and was sorry; but it was with\\r\\na sorrow so founded on satisfaction, so tending to ease, and so much in\\r\\nharmony with every dearest sensation, that there are few who might not\\r\\nhave been glad to exchange their greatest gaiety for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Thomas, poor Sir Thomas, a parent, and conscious of errors in his\\r\\nown conduct as a parent, was the longest to suffer. He felt that he\\r\\nought not to have allowed the marriage; that his daughter's sentiments\\r\\nhad been sufficiently known to him to render him culpable in authorising\\r\\nit; that in so doing he had sacrificed the right to the expedient, and\\r\\nbeen governed by motives of selfishness and worldly wisdom. These were\\r\\nreflections that required some time to soften; but time will do almost\\r\\neverything; and though little comfort arose on Mrs. Rushworth's side for\\r\\nthe misery she had occasioned, comfort was to be found greater than\\r\\nhe had supposed in his other children. Julia's match became a less\\r\\ndesperate business than he had considered it at first. She was humble,\\r\\nand wishing to be forgiven; and Mr. Yates, desirous of being really\\r\\nreceived into the family, was disposed to look up to him and be guided.\\r\\nHe was not very solid; but there was a hope of his becoming less\\r\\ntrifling, of his being at least tolerably domestic and quiet; and at any\\r\\nrate, there was comfort in finding his estate rather more, and his debts\\r\\nmuch less, than he had feared, and in being consulted and treated as\\r\\nthe friend best worth attending to. There was comfort also in Tom, who\\r\\ngradually regained his health, without regaining the thoughtlessness and\\r\\nselfishness of his previous habits. He was the better for ever for his\\r\\nillness. He had suffered, and he had learned to think: two advantages\\r\\nthat he had never known before; and the self-reproach arising from the\\r\\ndeplorable event in Wimpole Street, to which he felt himself accessory\\r\\nby all the dangerous intimacy of his unjustifiable theatre, made an\\r\\nimpression on his mind which, at the age of six-and-twenty, with no want\\r\\nof sense or good companions, was durable in its happy effects. He became\\r\\nwhat he ought to be: useful to his father, steady and quiet, and not\\r\\nliving merely for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was comfort indeed! and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place\\r\\ndependence on such sources of good, Edmund was contributing to his\\r\\nfather's ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given\\r\\nhim pain before--improvement in his spirits. After wandering about and\\r\\nsitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings, he had so well\\r\\ntalked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually brought their\\r\\nalleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his sense of what was lost, and\\r\\nin part reconciling him to himself; though the anguish arising from the\\r\\nconviction of his own errors in the education of his daughters was never\\r\\nto be entirely done away.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo late he became aware how unfavourable to the character of any young\\r\\npeople must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and Julia had\\r\\nbeen always experiencing at home, where the excessive indulgence and\\r\\nflattery of their aunt had been continually contrasted with his own\\r\\nseverity. He saw how ill he had judged, in expecting to counteract what\\r\\nwas wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself; clearly saw that he\\r\\nhad but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in\\r\\nhis presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him, and\\r\\nsending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able to\\r\\nattach them only by the blindness of her affection, and the excess of\\r\\nher praise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere had been grievous mismanagement; but, bad as it was, he gradually\\r\\ngrew to feel that it had not been the most direful mistake in his plan\\r\\nof education. Something must have been wanting _within_, or time would\\r\\nhave worn away much of its ill effect. He feared that principle, active\\r\\nprinciple, had been wanting; that they had never been properly taught\\r\\nto govern their inclinations and tempers by that sense of duty which can\\r\\nalone suffice. They had been instructed theoretically in their religion,\\r\\nbut never required to bring it into daily practice. To be distinguished\\r\\nfor elegance and accomplishments, the authorised object of their youth,\\r\\ncould have had no useful influence that way, no moral effect on the\\r\\nmind. He had meant them to be good, but his cares had been directed to\\r\\nthe understanding and manners, not the disposition; and of the necessity\\r\\nof self-denial and humility, he feared they had never heard from any\\r\\nlips that could profit them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcely\\r\\ncomprehend to have been possible. Wretchedly did he feel, that with all\\r\\nthe cost and care of an anxious and expensive education, he had brought\\r\\nup his daughters without their understanding their first duties, or his\\r\\nbeing acquainted with their character and temper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high spirit and strong passions of Mrs. Rushworth, especially, were\\r\\nmade known to him only in their sad result. She was not to be prevailed\\r\\non to leave Mr. Crawford. She hoped to marry him, and they continued\\r\\ntogether till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain,\\r\\nand till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the conviction\\r\\nrendered her temper so bad, and her feelings for him so like hatred,\\r\\nas to make them for a while each other's punishment, and then induce a\\r\\nvoluntary separation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his happiness\\r\\nin Fanny, and carried away no better consolation in leaving him than\\r\\nthat she _had_ divided them. What can exceed the misery of such a mind\\r\\nin such a situation?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce; and so ended a\\r\\nmarriage contracted under such circumstances as to make any better end\\r\\nthe effect of good luck not to be reckoned on. She had despised him,\\r\\nand loved another; and he had been very much aware that it was so. The\\r\\nindignities of stupidity, and the disappointments of selfish passion,\\r\\ncan excite little pity. His punishment followed his conduct, as did a\\r\\ndeeper punishment the deeper guilt of his wife. _He_ was released from\\r\\nthe engagement to be mortified and unhappy, till some other pretty girl\\r\\ncould attract him into matrimony again, and he might set forward on a\\r\\nsecond, and, it is to be hoped, more prosperous trial of the state: if\\r\\nduped, to be duped at least with good humour and good luck; while she\\r\\nmust withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings to a retirement and\\r\\nreproach which could allow no second spring of hope or character.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere she could be placed became a subject of most melancholy and\\r\\nmomentous consultation. Mrs. Norris, whose attachment seemed to augment\\r\\nwith the demerits of her niece, would have had her received at home\\r\\nand countenanced by them all. Sir Thomas would not hear of it; and Mrs.\\r\\nNorris's anger against Fanny was so much the greater, from considering\\r\\n_her_ residence there as the motive. She persisted in placing his\\r\\nscruples to _her_ account, though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her\\r\\nthat, had there been no young woman in question, had there been no young\\r\\nperson of either sex belonging to him, to be endangered by the society\\r\\nor hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth, he would never have offered\\r\\nso great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her.\\r\\nAs a daughter, he hoped a penitent one, she should be protected by him,\\r\\nand secured in every comfort, and supported by every encouragement to do\\r\\nright, which their relative situations admitted; but farther than _that_\\r\\nhe could not go. Maria had destroyed her own character, and he would\\r\\nnot, by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored, by\\r\\naffording his sanction to vice, or in seeking to lessen its disgrace, be\\r\\nanywise accessory to introducing such misery in another man's family as\\r\\nhe had known himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt ended in Mrs. Norris's resolving to quit Mansfield and devote herself\\r\\nto her unfortunate Maria, and in an establishment being formed for them\\r\\nin another country, remote and private, where, shut up together with\\r\\nlittle society, on one side no affection, on the other no judgment,\\r\\nit may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their mutual\\r\\npunishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Norris's removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary comfort\\r\\nof Sir Thomas's life. His opinion of her had been sinking from the day\\r\\nof his return from Antigua: in every transaction together from that\\r\\nperiod, in their daily intercourse, in business, or in chat, she had\\r\\nbeen regularly losing ground in his esteem, and convincing him that\\r\\neither time had done her much disservice, or that he had considerably\\r\\nover-rated her sense, and wonderfully borne with her manners before. He\\r\\nhad felt her as an hourly evil, which was so much the worse, as there\\r\\nseemed no chance of its ceasing but with life; she seemed a part of\\r\\nhimself that must be borne for ever. To be relieved from her, therefore,\\r\\nwas so great a felicity that, had she not left bitter remembrances\\r\\nbehind her, there might have been danger of his learning almost to\\r\\napprove the evil which produced such a good.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was regretted by no one at Mansfield. She had never been able to\\r\\nattach even those she loved best; and since Mrs. Rushworth's elopement,\\r\\nher temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her\\r\\neverywhere tormenting. Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris, not\\r\\neven when she was gone for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Julia escaped better than Maria was owing, in some measure, to a\\r\\nfavourable difference of disposition and circumstance, but in a greater\\r\\nto her having been less the darling of that very aunt, less flattered\\r\\nand less spoilt. Her beauty and acquirements had held but a second\\r\\nplace. She had been always used to think herself a little inferior to\\r\\nMaria. Her temper was naturally the easiest of the two; her feelings,\\r\\nthough quick, were more controllable, and education had not given her so\\r\\nvery hurtful a degree of self-consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had submitted the best to the disappointment in Henry Crawford.\\r\\nAfter the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was over,\\r\\nshe had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again;\\r\\nand when the acquaintance was renewed in town, and Mr. Rushworth's house\\r\\nbecame Crawford's object, she had had the merit of withdrawing herself\\r\\nfrom it, and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends,\\r\\nin order to secure herself from being again too much attracted. This had\\r\\nbeen her motive in going to her cousin's. Mr. Yates's convenience had\\r\\nhad nothing to do with it. She had been allowing his attentions some\\r\\ntime, but with very little idea of ever accepting him; and had not her\\r\\nsister's conduct burst forth as it did, and her increased dread of her\\r\\nfather and of home, on that event, imagining its certain consequence\\r\\nto herself would be greater severity and restraint, made her hastily\\r\\nresolve on avoiding such immediate horrors at all risks, it is probable\\r\\nthat Mr. Yates would never have succeeded. She had not eloped with any\\r\\nworse feelings than those of selfish alarm. It had appeared to her the\\r\\nonly thing to be done. Maria's guilt had induced Julia's folly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Crawford, ruined by early independence and bad domestic example,\\r\\nindulged in the freaks of a cold-blooded vanity a little too long. Once\\r\\nit had, by an opening undesigned and unmerited, led him into the way of\\r\\nhappiness. Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one\\r\\namiable woman's affections, could he have found sufficient exultation\\r\\nin overcoming the reluctance, in working himself into the esteem and\\r\\ntenderness of Fanny Price, there would have been every probability of\\r\\nsuccess and felicity for him. His affection had already done something.\\r\\nHer influence over him had already given him some influence over her.\\r\\nWould he have deserved more, there can be no doubt that more would have\\r\\nbeen obtained, especially when that marriage had taken place, which\\r\\nwould have given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her\\r\\nfirst inclination, and brought them very often together. Would he have\\r\\npersevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have been his reward, and a reward\\r\\nvery voluntarily bestowed, within a reasonable period from Edmund's\\r\\nmarrying Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad he done as he intended, and as he knew he ought, by going down to\\r\\nEveringham after his return from Portsmouth, he might have been deciding\\r\\nhis own happy destiny. But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser's\\r\\nparty; his staying was made of flattering consequence, and he was to\\r\\nmeet Mrs. Rushworth there. Curiosity and vanity were both engaged, and\\r\\nthe temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused to\\r\\nmake any sacrifice to right: he resolved to defer his Norfolk journey,\\r\\nresolved that writing should answer the purpose of it, or that its\\r\\npurpose was unimportant, and staid. He saw Mrs. Rushworth, was received\\r\\nby her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive, and have\\r\\nestablished apparent indifference between them for ever; but he was\\r\\nmortified, he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles\\r\\nhad been so wholly at his command: he must exert himself to subdue so\\r\\nproud a display of resentment; it was anger on Fanny's account; he must\\r\\nget the better of it, and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her\\r\\ntreatment of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this spirit he began the attack, and by animated perseverance had\\r\\nsoon re-established the sort of familiar intercourse, of gallantry,\\r\\nof flirtation, which bounded his views; but in triumphing over the\\r\\ndiscretion which, though beginning in anger, might have saved them both,\\r\\nhe had put himself in the power of feelings on her side more strong\\r\\nthan he had supposed. She loved him; there was no withdrawing attentions\\r\\navowedly dear to her. He was entangled by his own vanity, with as little\\r\\nexcuse of love as possible, and without the smallest inconstancy of mind\\r\\ntowards her cousin. To keep Fanny and the Bertrams from a knowledge of\\r\\nwhat was passing became his first object. Secrecy could not have been\\r\\nmore desirable for Mrs. Rushworth's credit than he felt it for his own.\\r\\nWhen he returned from Richmond, he would have been glad to see Mrs.\\r\\nRushworth no more. All that followed was the result of her imprudence;\\r\\nand he went off with her at last, because he could not help it,\\r\\nregretting Fanny even at the moment, but regretting her infinitely more\\r\\nwhen all the bustle of the intrigue was over, and a very few months had\\r\\ntaught him, by the force of contrast, to place a yet higher value on the\\r\\nsweetness of her temper, the purity of her mind, and the excellence of\\r\\nher principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat punishment, the public punishment of disgrace, should in a just\\r\\nmeasure attend _his_ share of the offence is, we know, not one of the\\r\\nbarriers which society gives to virtue. In this world the penalty is\\r\\nless equal than could be wished; but without presuming to look forward\\r\\nto a juster appointment hereafter, we may fairly consider a man of\\r\\nsense, like Henry Crawford, to be providing for himself no small\\r\\nportion of vexation and regret: vexation that must rise sometimes\\r\\nto self-reproach, and regret to wretchedness, in having so requited\\r\\nhospitality, so injured family peace, so forfeited his best, most\\r\\nestimable, and endeared acquaintance, and so lost the woman whom he had\\r\\nrationally as well as passionately loved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter what had passed to wound and alienate the two families, the\\r\\ncontinuance of the Bertrams and Grants in such close neighbourhood would\\r\\nhave been most distressing; but the absence of the latter, for some\\r\\nmonths purposely lengthened, ended very fortunately in the necessity, or\\r\\nat least the practicability, of a permanent removal. Dr. Grant, through\\r\\nan interest on which he had almost ceased to form hopes, succeeded to\\r\\na stall in Westminster, which, as affording an occasion for leaving\\r\\nMansfield, an excuse for residence in London, and an increase of income\\r\\nto answer the expenses of the change, was highly acceptable to those who\\r\\nwent and those who staid.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have gone with some\\r\\nregret from the scenes and people she had been used to; but the same\\r\\nhappiness of disposition must in any place, and any society, secure her\\r\\na great deal to enjoy, and she had again a home to offer Mary; and Mary\\r\\nhad had enough of her own friends, enough of vanity, ambition, love, and\\r\\ndisappointment in the course of the last half-year, to be in need of the\\r\\ntrue kindness of her sister's heart, and the rational tranquillity\\r\\nof her ways. They lived together; and when Dr. Grant had brought on\\r\\napoplexy and death, by three great institutionary dinners in one week,\\r\\nthey still lived together; for Mary, though perfectly resolved against\\r\\never attaching herself to a younger brother again, was long in finding\\r\\namong the dashing representatives, or idle heir-apparents, who were at\\r\\nthe command of her beauty, and her \\xc2\\xa320,000, any one who could satisfy the\\r\\nbetter taste she had acquired at Mansfield, whose character and manners\\r\\ncould authorise a hope of the domestic happiness she had there learned\\r\\nto estimate, or put Edmund Bertram sufficiently out of her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect. He had not to\\r\\nwait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed her\\r\\nin them. Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford, and observing to\\r\\nFanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another\\r\\nwoman, before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of\\r\\nwoman might not do just as well, or a great deal better: whether Fanny\\r\\nherself were not growing as dear, as important to him in all her smiles\\r\\nand all her ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been; and whether it might\\r\\nnot be a possible, an hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm\\r\\nand sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love.\\r\\n\\r\\nI purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that every one may\\r\\nbe at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable\\r\\npassions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as\\r\\nto time in different people. I only entreat everybody to believe that\\r\\nexactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so, and\\r\\nnot a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and\\r\\nbecame as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such a regard for her, indeed, as his had long been, a regard\\r\\nfounded on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness, and\\r\\ncompleted by every recommendation of growing worth, what could be more\\r\\nnatural than the change? Loving, guiding, protecting her, as he had been\\r\\ndoing ever since her being ten years old, her mind in so great a degree\\r\\nformed by his care, and her comfort depending on his kindness, an\\r\\nobject to him of such close and peculiar interest, dearer by all his own\\r\\nimportance with her than any one else at Mansfield, what was there now\\r\\nto add, but that he should learn to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling\\r\\ndark ones. And being always with her, and always talking confidentially,\\r\\nand his feelings exactly in that favourable state which a recent\\r\\ndisappointment gives, those soft light eyes could not be very long in\\r\\nobtaining the pre-eminence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving once set out, and felt that he had done so on this road to\\r\\nhappiness, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him or make\\r\\nhis progress slow; no doubts of her deserving, no fears of opposition of\\r\\ntaste, no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarity\\r\\nof temper. Her mind, disposition, opinions, and habits wanted no\\r\\nhalf-concealment, no self-deception on the present, no reliance on\\r\\nfuture improvement. Even in the midst of his late infatuation, he had\\r\\nacknowledged Fanny's mental superiority. What must be his sense of it\\r\\nnow, therefore? She was of course only too good for him; but as nobody\\r\\nminds having what is too good for them, he was very steadily earnest in\\r\\nthe pursuit of the blessing, and it was not possible that encouragement\\r\\nfrom her should be long wanting. Timid, anxious, doubting as she was, it\\r\\nwas still impossible that such tenderness as hers should not, at times,\\r\\nhold out the strongest hope of success, though it remained for a later\\r\\nperiod to tell him the whole delightful and astonishing truth. His\\r\\nhappiness in knowing himself to have been so long the beloved of such a\\r\\nheart, must have been great enough to warrant any strength of language\\r\\nin which he could clothe it to her or to himself; it must have been\\r\\na delightful happiness. But there was happiness elsewhere which no\\r\\ndescription can reach. Let no one presume to give the feelings of a\\r\\nyoung woman on receiving the assurance of that affection of which she\\r\\nhas scarcely allowed herself to entertain a hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir own inclinations ascertained, there were no difficulties behind,\\r\\nno drawback of poverty or parent. It was a match which Sir Thomas's\\r\\nwishes had even forestalled. Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions,\\r\\nprizing more and more the sterling good of principle and temper, and\\r\\nchiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities all that remained to\\r\\nhim of domestic felicity, he had pondered with genuine satisfaction on\\r\\nthe more than possibility of the two young friends finding their natural\\r\\nconsolation in each other for all that had occurred of disappointment to\\r\\neither; and the joyful consent which met Edmund's application, the high\\r\\nsense of having realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny for\\r\\na daughter, formed just such a contrast with his early opinion on the\\r\\nsubject when the poor little girl's coming had been first agitated, as\\r\\ntime is for ever producing between the plans and decisions of mortals,\\r\\nfor their own instruction, and their neighbours' entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted. His charitable kindness\\r\\nhad been rearing a prime comfort for himself. His liberality had a rich\\r\\nrepayment, and the general goodness of his intentions by her deserved\\r\\nit. He might have made her childhood happier; but it had been an error\\r\\nof judgment only which had given him the appearance of harshness, and\\r\\ndeprived him of her early love; and now, on really knowing each other,\\r\\ntheir mutual attachment became very strong. After settling her at\\r\\nThornton Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort, the object of\\r\\nalmost every day was to see her there, or to get her away from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelfishly dear as she had long been to Lady Bertram, she could not be\\r\\nparted with willingly by _her_. No happiness of son or niece could make\\r\\nher wish the marriage. But it was possible to part with her, because\\r\\nSusan remained to supply her place. Susan became the stationary niece,\\r\\ndelighted to be so; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of\\r\\nmind, and an inclination for usefulness, as Fanny had been by sweetness\\r\\nof temper, and strong feelings of gratitude. Susan could never be\\r\\nspared. First as a comfort to Fanny, then as an auxiliary, and last as\\r\\nher substitute, she was established at Mansfield, with every appearance\\r\\nof equal permanency. Her more fearless disposition and happier nerves\\r\\nmade everything easy to her there. With quickness in understanding\\r\\nthe tempers of those she had to deal with, and no natural timidity to\\r\\nrestrain any consequent wishes, she was soon welcome and useful to all;\\r\\nand after Fanny's removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over\\r\\nthe hourly comfort of her aunt, as gradually to become, perhaps, the\\r\\nmost beloved of the two. In _her_ usefulness, in Fanny's excellence,\\r\\nin William's continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the general\\r\\nwell-doing and success of the other members of the family, all assisting\\r\\nto advance each other, and doing credit to his countenance and aid, Sir\\r\\nThomas saw repeated, and for ever repeated, reason to rejoice in what he\\r\\nhad done for them all, and acknowledge the advantages of early hardship\\r\\nand discipline, and the consciousness of being born to struggle and\\r\\nendure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith so much true merit and true love, and no want of fortune and\\r\\nfriends, the happiness of the married cousins must appear as secure as\\r\\nearthly happiness can be. Equally formed for domestic life, and attached\\r\\nto country pleasures, their home was the home of affection and comfort;\\r\\nand to complete the picture of good, the acquisition of Mansfield\\r\\nliving, by the death of Dr. Grant, occurred just after they had been\\r\\nmarried long enough to begin to want an increase of income, and feel\\r\\ntheir distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage there,\\r\\nwhich, under each of its two former owners, Fanny had never been able\\r\\nto approach but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm, soon\\r\\ngrew as dear to her heart, and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes, as\\r\\neverything else within the view and patronage of Mansfield Park had long\\r\\nbeen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mansfield Park, by Jane Austen\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MANSFIELD PARK ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 141-0.txt or 141-0.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/141/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\""
